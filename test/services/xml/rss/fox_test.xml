      <title>Black Eyed Peas star predicts which jobs may go extinct thanks to AI</title>

      <description>Black Eyed Peas star will.i.am has predictions about who will thrive and who won&amp;apos;t as artificial intelligence begins to be used more and more in the music industry.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;will.i.am doesn’t think true artists should worry about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only thing to be worried about is if you&apos;re making music to chase an algorithm,&quot; he told Fox News Digital. &quot;If you&apos;re making music to trend on TikTok. And to do that, you have to really unlock the codes to that matrix. If that&apos;s your whole [hustle], then AI is going to do a better job than that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Black Eyed Peas singer does think people not involved in the creative process in the music industry are the ones who should worry about AI taking away their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/what-is-ai-artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The people that are at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/eddie-van-halens-brother-wants-ai-complete-bands-unreleased-music&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;risk of AI in the music [industry]&lt;/a&gt; are managers, label execs, finance auditors, attorneys. If you look at the money that&apos;s being put [in]to make these systems more advanced, Microsoft is giving you a copilot [the company’s AI assistant]. And there&apos;s nothing slowing down how freaking awesome that&apos;s going to be in 2025 version eight. And that&apos;s going to be used for all types of industries,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s not an army or a fleet of AI music do[ing] everything to the level of copilots or sales force agents. So musicians and hyper-creatives are okay. We&apos;re going to use AI and reinvent and create a whole new industry because of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, &quot;Right now, AI does a good job of everything that we&apos;ve created and can mimic it. But AI is not making things that don&apos;t exist exist. We do that. We created AI. So AI is a mirror. It shows you exactly what&apos;s in front of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/black-eyed-peas-star-taps-ai-bot-radio-show-co-host-didnt-want-to-just-do-a-traditional-show&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLACK EYED PEAS STAR TAPS AI BOT AS RADIO SHOW CO-HOST: &apos;DIDN’T WANT TO JUST DO A TRADITIONAL SHOW&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: BLACK EYED PEAS STAR EXPLAINS WHAT AI CAN AND CAN&apos;T DO CREATIVELY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will.i.am has been involved with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jared-leto-invests-500m-ai-startup-despite-calls-from-other-stars-shut-down-controversial-tech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AI-related platforms&lt;/a&gt; and tech for several years now, including his app FYI, an AI-powered app designed to help creatives with productivity through messaging and file management tools, as well as content publishing &quot;to create an all-in-one experience,&quot; per their website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they’re launching &quot;CONVOS,&quot; a content series featuring artists and creatives having on-on-one conversations with the AI person in the FYI.AI app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inspiration came from a French series that will.i.am saw called &quot;Colors&quot; that reminded him of his own experiences promoting music there and improvising material, and he made the connection with his app’s own AI personas to do something unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[I thought]&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;what if there was a way to have a different type of performance that&apos;s conversation-based? And then after the conversation, the principal, the artist, the creative jams out, does poetry or a song. Because that&apos;s really what a song or some creative endeavors [are] about. It&apos;s about, like, this discovery process,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will.i.am continued, saying the goal was to create more of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ai-generated-marilyn-monroe-chatbot-raises-ethical-questions-on-using-dead-celebrities-likeness-experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;banter with AI.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot is happening when you&apos;re talking to yourself. But this is like a different version of that,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re not talking to yourself, but you&apos;re talking to some type of chalkboard or banter board or mirror that’s able to give you real time reflection without having to be weird speaking out loud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/randy-travis-wife-mary-thank-ai-giving-him-voice-back&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RANDY TRAVIS, WIFE MARY THANK AI FOR GIVING HIM HIS VOICE BACK: ‘IT’S BEEN MAGICAL’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will.i.am added, &quot;It&apos;s a different way to digest what&apos;s on your mind. There&apos;s people that are conversationalists for a living, they like to talk. And a lot of times these people can exhaust the other person on the other end, you know? And in this case, it&apos;s not an interview. It&apos;s like a banter with yourself and some slice of intelligence on the other end to give you what you&apos;re saying back at you without judgment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: BLACK EYED PEAS STAR EXPLAINS INSPIRATION BEHIND NEW SERIES FEATURING AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;CONVOS&quot; episodes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sheryl-crow-terrified-by-ai-fears-technology-inspired-new-song&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;feature musicians and artists&lt;/a&gt; also working out lyrics and new material with the FYI.AI, receiving feedback and suggestions to complete the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while will.i.am, of course, likes what his AI app has to offer, saying, &quot;You can engage and discover things that the world of information has for you to learn,&quot; he encourages people to question what answers and comments it provides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But then, at the same time, push it. Push the AI… It&apos;s not holy,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, &quot;It’s not some precious wall that whatever it says is. There&apos;s a lot of people that what they read on social media, on Twitter, or they see on a post [and think] ‘It&apos;s got to be real. Well, it has to [have] been real. Look. It&apos;s trending.’ No, bro. Those are motherf---ing bots. You just think you&apos;re talking to a f---ing human.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With FYI.AI, &quot;you know you&apos;re talking to a f---ing A.I… You know it. No one’s lying to you. So push it. Push it. Push it to get the information. But don&apos;t bubble yourself. Be mindful that you know what it will be.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/black-mirror-creator-says-ai-technology-isnt-problem-its-how-you-use-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; Know what you&apos;re talking to&lt;/a&gt;. And use it for research. But don&apos;t get lost in the sauce is [what I] caution as they have fun with it,&quot; said will.i.am. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s somebody&apos;s art. You&apos;re going to find some truth there. But if it&apos;s too good to be true, push that s---.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Lions clinch playoff spot with walk-off field goal in epic high-scoring affair against Packers</title>

      <description>The Lions are back in the playoffs and have won 11 games in a row, this one being in walk-off fashion in a high-scoring affair against the Packers.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dan Campbell&lt;/a&gt; sure knows how to keep things interesting - but it worked out on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell&apos;s aggressive coaching gave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; a 34-31 walk-off victory over the Green Bay Packers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions took a 17-7 lead into the half, but the Packers cut the deficit with their first drive out of the locker room after Tucker Kraft scored. On the ensuing drive, Jared Goff threw a rough interception in his own end, and the Packers took advantage by ending the next drive with Josh Jacobs&apos; second touchdown of the night to take a 21-17 lead at the snap of a finger. Goff, though, marched down the field, and he found Tim Patrick in the painted area to regain a three-point lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in the third, the Lions did what they usually do - be aggressive. But going for it on 4th and 1 from their own 31 didn&apos;t work out, and the Packers were inside the 10 to kick off the fourth quarter. Jacobs quickly had his third touchdown of the night, and the Packers led, 28-24. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&apos;s hard to quit on the Lions, and Tim Patrick had his second touchdown of the night to get Detroit back up three points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/green-bay-packers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Packers&lt;/a&gt; kicked a field goal with just under four minutes left to tie the game, but the Lions offense did what they normally do and got inside the 20. However, Dan Campbell did Dan Campbell things, going for it on 4th and inches in what was a huge risk. This time, it worked out, and with Green Bay out of timeouts, Jake Bates was able to walk it off from 35 yards out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/packers-head-coach-lions-fan-separated-field-before-rivalry-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PACKERS HEAD COACH, LIONS FAN SEPARATED ON FIELD BEFORE RIVALRY GAME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s now an 11-game winning streak for the Lions, the longest in team history - they are now back in the playoffs for a second consecutive year. It&apos;s the first time making the playoffs in back-to-back years since they did so from 1993 to 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goff was 32-for-41 for 283 yards and three touchdowns, and Jameson Williams led the way with 80 receiving yards. Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs combined for 94 yards on the ground, with each finding the end zone once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Bay is now 9-4 on the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump continues round of appointments with 3 new picks to top homeland security, immigration</title>

      <description>President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday continued rolling out picks to serve on his Cabinet and other top roles, including border security and mass deportation operation nominees.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President-elect Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has been aggressively rolling out his picks to serve in his Cabinet and other top roles. Thursday was no different as he focused on picks that would work hard to secure the border and carry out a mass deportation operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump added nominees for homeland security and immigration, naming Rodney Scott as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Caleb Vitello as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Tony Salisbury to be Deputy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Homeland Security Advisor&lt;/a&gt; (White House Homeland Security Council).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RODNEY SCOTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is a former Border Patrol chief who served as chief from 2020 until he was ousted by the Biden administration in mid-2021. Since then, he has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies and its handling of the crisis at the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before being chief, he had led the San Diego Sector, one of the most challenging sectors in the country. He has been highly critical of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and recently accused him of having &quot;intentionally&quot; opened the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cabinet-nominees-appointees-targeted-violent-unamerican-threats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP CABINET NOMINEES, APPOINTEES TARGETED WITH &apos;VIOLENT, UNAMERICAN THREATS&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6343672377112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Rodney served nearly&lt;/a&gt; three decades in the Border Patrol, building vast experience and knowledge in Law Enforcement and Border Security. Rodney served as the 24th Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, where he implemented Remain-in-Mexico, Title 42, Safe Third Agreements, and achieved record low levels of illegal immigration,&quot; Trump said in a statement on Truth Social. &quot;He began his career with the Border Patrol in 1992 at the Imperial Beach Station, San Diego Sector. Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, he served as an Anti-Terrorism Advisor to the CBP Commissioner, and later, as Deputy Executive Director of the CBP, Office of Anti-Terrorism.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALEB VITELLO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitello has served at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;White House National&lt;/a&gt; Security Council as the Director for Interior Enforcement as well as serving as Unit Chief and Deputy Assistant Director of the National Fugitive Operations Program within ERO’s Enforcement Division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A member of the Senior Executive Service, with over 23 years of service to ICE, Caleb currently serves as Assistant Director of the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs, where he oversees Agency-wide training, equipment, and policy to ensure Officer and Public Safety,&quot; Trump said in a statement said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-furor-unqualified-trump-nominees-puts-bidens-staffing-decisions-back-spotlight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEMOCRATS&apos; FUROR OVER &apos;UNQUALIFIED&apos; TRUMP NOMINEES PUTS BIDEN&apos;S STAFFING DECISIONS BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Caleb led the Fugitive Operations Academy, served as Deputy Assistant Director, and directed the National Fugitive Operations Program, providing policy guidance, strategic planning, and operational oversight for efforts to locate, arrest, and remove at-large, dangerous criminals and illegal aliens from the U.S. As Chief of Staff for Enforcement and Removal Operations, he managed daily operations for an organization with a $4.7 Billion Dollar budget and 8,000 employees. At the White House National Security Council, Caleb led initiatives focused on child safety and national security threats.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TONY SALISBURY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salisbury currently serves as the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has served as the Acting Deputy Executive Associate Director (EAD) for the entire ICE/HSI workforce and previously held key leadership, field and headquarters assignments for ICE/HIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump noted he was particularly successful at &quot;all of HSI&apos;s complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Federal Law Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; investigative programs related to National Security and smuggling violations, including counter-proliferation, financial crimes, commercial fraud, human trafficking, human smuggling, narcotics smuggling, transnational gangs, cyber-crimes, child exploitation, worksite enforcement and document and benefit fraud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tony will bring his vast Law Enforcement, counter-narcotics, and counter-cartel experience to the White House where he will serve under Stephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor,&quot; Trump said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

At one point, Creighton led by 17 en route to the 76-63 victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the game, Creighton head coach Greg McDermott made a bold claim. &quot;This is the building [where] No. 1 teams go to die evidently,&quot; the coach said as fans stormed the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To McDermott&apos;s point, Creighton was able to pull off a similar feat last season by upsetting the then top-ranked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/connecticut-huskies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;UConn Huskies&lt;/a&gt; on their home court in Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bluejays 85-66 victory in February also sparked a court-storming moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsu-star-flaujae-johnson-says-unrivaled-league-changing-game-she-joins-nil-partnership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU STAR FLAU&apos;JAE JOHNSON SAYS UNRIVALED LEAGUE &apos;CHANGING THE GAME&apos; AS SHE JOINS IN NIL PARTNERSHIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under McDermott, Creighton has made nine appearances in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA tournament&lt;/a&gt;, advancing to the Sweet 16 on three occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bluejays win over Kansas marked the program&apos;s 15th win over a top-10 opponent since McDermott became the head coach in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creighton is scheduled to remain in Omaha for its next game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/unlv-rebels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;against UNLV&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Hero deacon who jumped on gunman awarded for his bravery by Fox Nation, surprised by man he saved</title>

      <description>A deacon who tackled a gunman was surprised by the pastor he saved during a church service and was recognized for his bravery at the Fox Nation Patriot Awards.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An American hero who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/hero-tackled-pennsylvania-church-gunman-breaks-silence-my-pastor-life-was-in-danger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tackled a Pennsylvania church gunman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was surprised by the pastor he saved while being recognized for his bravery at the Fox Nation Patriot Awards.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deacon Clarence McCallister of Jesus&apos; Dwelling Place in North Braddock, Pa., watched in horror when an armed man pointed his gun at Pastor Glenn Germany in the middle of a church service in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man pulled the trigger, the gun did not fire and McCallister tackled him before he could take another shot. Months later, the two united on the Fox Nation stage at the Patriot Awards and expressed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/bible-sales-surge-thanks-fresh-editions-new-buyers-looking-things-feel-more-solid-report-finds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gratitude to God&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for sparing their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In America here, we&apos;re all heroes,&quot; McCallister said while accepting the &quot;Award for Bravery&quot; and expressing gratitude to his family. &quot;We&apos;re all heroes. We all have the heart to do whatever it takes that we need to do... We got mother instincts. We&apos;re going to do anything to protect our children. We&apos;re going to do anything to protect our loved ones.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-man-aims-gun-pastor-church-interrupts-sermon-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PENNSYLVANIA MAN AIMS GUN AT PASTOR IN CHURCH, INTERRUPTS SERMON ON VIDEO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany, who surprised his McCallister in a heartfelt entrance, said it&apos;s &quot;good to be alive.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bakery-christmas-recreates-nativity-scene-bread-life-made-bread&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;God&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for protecting me and watching over me,&quot; Germany said. &quot;I thank God for keeping this angel. Hallelujah! Having him making sure that nothing happened to no one else inside our building. So, I&apos;m really grateful. I truly thank the Lord for protecting me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today is the day of Thanksgiving,&quot; he continued. &quot;I&apos;m thankful for my lovely wife who was here with me, and she&apos;s always been an anchor for me, and I&apos;m just so grateful to have her in my life.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany also offered a &quot;true, sincere word&quot; to President-elect Donald Trump in light of the attempt on his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The young man who attempted that, I forgave him, and it&apos;s all about us loving these young men, young women who are going through mental illness,&quot; Germany said. &quot;They need our help, and I&apos;m just praying today that we can work together and show them love. God bless you, America. We have the greatest country, and I pray that it becomes the safest and greatest country.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Michael Ruiz contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Canada bans more assault firearms, suggests donating guns to Ukraine</title>

      <description>Top leaders in Canada announced that they had banned an additional 324 assault-style firearms in a continued effort for more stringent gun control.</description>

Last month, that number grew to more than 2,000 as new models were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Firearms designed for the battlefield plainly do not belong in our communities,&quot; Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs, said. &quot;Too often, these types of weapons have been used to commit some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/north-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;worst atrocities Canada&lt;/a&gt; has ever witnessed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to Public Safety Canada for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From legal battles to assassination attempts to the ballot box, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/president-elect-donald-trump-receives-patriot-year-award-fox-nations-patriot-awards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President-elect Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; has had a historic year, culminating in his monumental victory in the 2024 presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the incoming president prepares for his transition back to the White House, Trump was awarded the Fox Nation &quot;Patriot of the Year Award&quot; during Thursday&apos;s show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trumps-biden-president-elect-overshadows-white-house-incumbent-world-stage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going to achieve it again&lt;/a&gt; and very fast. It&apos;s going to be very fast because we have no choice. But we&apos;re going to do something that I&apos;ve been talking about for eight years. We&apos;re going to do it again. We have to do it again,&quot; Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going to be very proud of our country again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOX WEATHER ULTIMATE PATRIOT AWARD - GENERAL DICK CODY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When communities across the southeast were rocked by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/americans-spend-thanksgiving-tents-after-helene-heat-electricity-food-still-hard-find&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hurricane Helene&lt;/a&gt; in September, former Army vice chief of staff Gen. Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Cody stepped up to help North Carolina residents suffering a catastrophe of biblical proportions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/americas-newsroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;America&apos;s Newsroom&quot;&lt;/a&gt; co-anchors Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino presented Cody with the FOX Weather &quot;Ultimate Patriot Award,&quot; honoring his service to the affected communities in the Tar Heel State. Samaritan&apos;s Purse COO Edward Graham joined Cody on stage to receive the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was just one of probably 100 helicopter pilots that showed up and answered the call to duty one more time for the devastation in North Carolina. A lot of civilian helicopters, a lot of active duty helicopter pilots and stuff... So I accept this award very humbly on behalf of all of them, because they did some great work out there,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-biden-pledges-1b-aid-africa-north-carolina-residents-continue-struggle-after-helene&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN PLEDGES $1B IN AID TO AFRICA AS NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AFTER HELENE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With historic flooding and widespread devastation nearly wiping out entire communities, volunteers rushed to the Tar Heel State to help with rescue and recovery efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cody joined the list of volunteers, flying his helicopter to deliver emergency supplies to residents suffering in the western Appalachian region, including generators, fuel and blankets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After accepting his award, Cody urged viewers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6364928644112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;not to &quot;forget the people in North Carolina.&lt;/a&gt; Our work is not done there yet. Keep supporting them and keep them in their prayers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T2T STEPHEN SILLER BACK THE BLUE AWARD - JONATHAN DILLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Diller family, a routine traffic stop in March changed everything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-attends-slain-nypd-officer-jonathan-dillers-wake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller&lt;/a&gt; was shot and killed in Queens allegedly by a suspect with more than 20 prior arrests, prompting national outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller is survived by his 1-year-old son and wife, Stephanie, who accepted the &quot;T2T Stephen Siller Back the Blue Award&quot; on her husband&apos;s behalf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tonight is especially special because I&apos;m receiving this award from Stephen Siller. And looking at Stephen, a man who also lost his father and is up here supporting us, it gives me hope that my son will be okay,&quot; Stephanie said after receiving the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nypd-officer-jonathan-dillers-neighbor-retired-9-11-responder-says-hochul-das-have-blood-their-hands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYPD OFFICER JONATHAN DILLER&apos;S NEIGHBOR, A RETIRED 9/11 RESPONDER, SAYS HOCUL, DAS HAVE ‘BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy Rivera, 34, allegedly opened fire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;during a traffic stop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Diller and his partner in Far Rockaway, Queens, on a vehicle illegally parked at a bus stop back in March. Rivera, who was in the passenger seat, allegedly fired first at police, fatally striking Diller in the torso below his protective vest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera was also struck by return fire and was reportedly hospitalized. Like Rivera, the driver of the vehicle, 41-year-old Lindy Jones, also had at least 20 prior arrests, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although we suffered this tragedy, we will not live a tragic life, and we will live a life that supports the legacy and the spirit of who Jonathan was,&quot; Stephanie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUNG PATRIOT AWARD - CAMERON BLASEK  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While only a senior in high school, Cameron Blasek stood his ground after school administrators in St. Leon, Ind., reportedly attempted to stop him from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/indiana-high-school-student-speaks-out-after-going-viral-refusing-remove-us-flag-truck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;displaying the American flag&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blasek&apos;s commitment to the flag earned him the &quot;Young Patriot Award,&quot; presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-faulkner-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Faulkner Focus&quot;&lt;/a&gt; host Harris Faulkner and OutKick&apos;s Tomi Lahren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to say that I&apos;m humbled and proud to get this award tonight,&quot; Blasek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to say to the brave men and women out there who serve our country, thank you. Your sacrifices are the true essence of patriotism. The sacrifices I made of willing to be suspended and possibly expelled from high school is nothing compared to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/national-outrage-prompts-nj-town-humbly-apologize-american-flag-ban-residents-say-its-bs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL OUTRAGE PROMPTS NJ TOWN TO ‘HUMBLY APOLOGIZE’ FOR AMERICAN FLAG BAN, BUT RESIDENTS SAY IT&apos;S ‘BS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blasek proudly displayed an American flag on his truck for most of his senior year, but he said school administrators told him it broke school rules and needed to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high school senior refused to take down the flag, inspiring other students to join in displaying American flags. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/indiana-student-receives-patriotic-surprise-high-school-bans-old-glory-display-hold-your-ground&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Blasek was even given&lt;/a&gt; a red, white and blue truck from GCI Digital, a business based out of nearby Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blasek extended his thanks to a family in Oklahoma after accepting his award Thursday night. The family from Hollis, Okla. had a 13-year-old battling cancer who wanted to take a ride in Blasek&apos;s patriotic truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He reached out and said that he wanted his final ride to be in my truck. So me and my father, we made that happen. We drove all the way down there and we did it. So I want to give a thank you to them for welcoming me into their lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SALUTE TO SERVICE AWARD - PAULA PEDENE &amp;amp; DR. SAM FOOTE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly a decade ago, then-Veterans Affairs employees Paula Pedene and Dr. Sam Foote blew the whistle on the agency for allegedly failing to serve the nation&apos;s service men and women back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pedene and Foote were given the &quot;Salute to Service Award,&quot; presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/fox-friends-weekend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&quot;&lt;/a&gt; co-hosts Will Cain and Rachel Campos-Duffy, to mark ten years since coming forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the VA is still at a crossroads,&quot; Pedene said, accepting the award on behalf of her and Foote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our veterans deserve the best.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/sisters-raise-thousands-help-senior-veterans-take-part-honor-flights-we-love-our-veterans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHIO SISTERS RAISE THOUSANDS TO HELP SENIOR VETERANS TAKE PART IN HONOR FLIGHTS: ‘WE LOVE OUR VETERANS’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/va-settles-complaints-by-3-phoenix-whistleblowers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The whistleblower colleagues&lt;/a&gt; not only exposed one of the largest scandals in VA history, but also prompted major reform ensuring better care for future generations of veterans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To all the whistleblowers out there, it&apos;s a good fight. It&apos;s a tough one, but it&apos;s a good one. We need truth. We need accountability. Thank you for what you do,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWARD FOR SERVICE TO VETERANS - PAWS OF WAR &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/deployed-soldier-pleads-rescue-puppy-found-overseas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Paws of War&lt;/a&gt; was awarded the &quot;Service to Veterans Award&quot; for helping bring hundreds of dogs and cats, rescued by U.S. troops serving overseas, to safety in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that what people don&apos;t realize is when a military member is serving overseas, they&apos;re trained for a lot. They&apos;re not trained to find this little puppy or a kitten that they fall in love with. And then they have to come back and there&apos;s very little options for them to bring that animal back. And that&apos;s what we do,&quot; Paws of War co-founder Robert Misseri said during the Patriot Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/veterans-ptsd-significant-benefits-service-dogs-nih-funded-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VETERANS WITH PTSD GET ‘SIGNIFICANT’ BENEFITS FROM SERVICE DOGS, FIRST NIH-FUNDED STUDY FINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission of the non-profit is to &quot;alleviate the suffering of veterans, first responders and their families&quot; through a number of programs including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6364542762112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;providing service dogs.&lt;/a&gt; Since it was founded in 2014, Paws of War has served nearly 1,000 veterans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misseri was joined on stage by Army National Guard Specialist Cameron Clay, who was surprised by a reunion with a dog he rescued while overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t even know how to feel,&quot; Clay said, embracing his four-legged friend. &quot;So, so thankful to everyone involved. Paws of War and everyone on base who helped me through this whole process. It&apos;s just amazing. I don&apos;t even know what to think right now. It&apos;s just so great. Thank you, everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CULTURE WARRIOR AWARD - KIRK CAMERON  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/kirk-cameron-urges-americans-faith-be-brave-vote-values-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kirk Cameron&lt;/a&gt; faced an onslaught of pushback from libraries across the country over his children&apos;s book &lt;i&gt;As You Grow&lt;/i&gt;, sparking a nationwide movement against woke entertainment for kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron received the &quot;Culture Warrior Award,&quot; presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Story&quot;&lt;/a&gt; anchor Martha MacCallum and Fox News contributor Tyrus, commemorating his fight to defend traditional family values nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a heart full of gratitude just to be counted together with you this evening for this important night of honoring people all over this country, these unsung heroes who are doing such important work. I think we all know that in order to shape the future, we have to get to the hearts and minds of our children and to the grandchildren,&quot; Cameron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/kirk-cameron-premieres-his-modern-day-mister-rogers-neighborhood-blasts-state-childrens-entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KIRK CAMERON PREMIERES HIS ‘MODERN-DAY MISTER ROGERS’ NEIGHBORHOOD,&apos; BLASTS STATE OF CHILDREN&apos;S ENTERTAINMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since releasing his children&apos;s book, Cameron has continued releasing books and hosted a &quot;See You at the Library&quot; event in August, which drew 30,000 people at libraries across the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that God has given us a new day,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;There is a spirit of hope and optimism that is in the air. We can see the future more clearly now. And I honestly believe that that heaven&apos;s clocks keep perfect time. And the last four years have been a perfect window into the future we could have taken. And as a nation, I believe we really dodged a bullet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron&apos;s latest enterprise is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/kirk-cameron-premieres-his-modern-day-mister-rogers-neighborhood-blasts-state-childrens-entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new Christian children&apos;s show&lt;/a&gt; billed as the &quot;modern-day Mister Rogers&apos; Neighborhood&quot; in an effort to combat the current &quot;woke&quot; state of children&apos;s entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWARD FOR BRAVERY - CLARENCE MCCALLISTER &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a deacon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/pennsylvania-pastor-forgives-gunman-attempted-shooting-mid-sermon-miracle-grateful-god&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;leaped into action to stop a gunman&lt;/a&gt; who pointed a loaded gun at a pastor during a Sunday afternoon service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;63-year-old Clarence McCallister was honored with the &quot;Award for Bravery&quot; for his heroic and selfless actions defending the Pennsylvania preacher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In America here, we&apos;re all heroes. We&apos;re all heroes. We all have the heart to do whatever it takes that we need to do,&quot; McCallister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-passerby-saves-man-burning-home-kicking-down-storm-door&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEORGIA PASSERBY SAVES MAN FROM BURNING HOME BY KICKING DOWN STORM DOOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCallister was taping the service at Jesus&apos; Dwelling Place Church in North Braddock, Penn., when 26-year-old Bernard Polite approached the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/pennsylvania-pastor-forgives-gunman-attempted-shooting-mid-sermon-miracle-grateful-god&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;pulpit with a firearm pointed&lt;/a&gt; at Pastor Glenn Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deacon helped tackle the gunman, eventually removing the weapon from his possession, until police arrived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany surprised McCallister on stage, thanking the deacon for his selfless act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thank God for protecting me and watching over me. I thank God for keeping this angel. Having him making sure that nothing happened to no one else inside our building,&quot; Germany said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;The young man who attempted that, I forgave him. And it&apos;s all about us loving these young men, young women whose going through mental illness. They need our help.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWARD FOR COURAGE - UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL PHI DELTA THETA FRATERNITY BROTHERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleges nationwide witnessed widespread and violent protests over the war in Israel. In the midst of the chaos, members of the University of North Carolina&apos;s Phi Delta Theta fraternity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/gop-lawmaker-sends-letter-frat-brothers-defended-american-flag-parents-raised-right&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;captured the attention of the nation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by holding up the American flag as pro-Palestinian protesters tried to replace the Stars and Stripes with a Palestinian flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the fraternity brothers, Guillermo Estrada and Alex Jones, received the &quot;Award for Courage&quot; for the group&apos;s heroic act of patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The outreach of support from not only the people that are here in this room, but across the nation has really been something that has been both inspiring and humbling,&quot; Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/unc-frat-members-protected-american-flag-recount-chaotic-protest-blew-my-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNC FRAT MEMBERS WHO PROTECTED AMERICAN FLAG RECOUNT CHAOTIC PROTESTS: ‘BLEW MY MIND’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After enduring nearly an hour of screaming, slurring and flying objects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/unc-fraternity-brothers-defend-reinstated-american-flag-campus-mob-replaced-palestinian-flag&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the fraternity brothers held up the fallen American flag&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; until it could be restored. A GoFundMe was started to throw a party for the fraternities involved, which raised over half a million dollars by the time donations closed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We didn&apos;t hesitate when we saw our flag being torn back down because this flag represents the beacon of hope that called my parents to this great country 20 years ago,&quot; Estrada added. &quot;The promise of liberty and prosperity that makes America a light to the world. That is what that flag represents. And to those – to those that still, for some reason questioned the meaning and importance of the flag. I invite you to sit down with families like mine from Goldsboro, North Carolina, family like Alex&apos;s, and to listen to truly what the red, white and blue truly means to us once again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox Nation&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; sixth installment of the Patriot Awards was a night to bridge political gaps, unite behind a love of America and celebrate America&apos;s everyday heroes.

      <title>Mark Halperin says donors who ignored Biden’s state ‘blame him’ for election loss ‘more than themselves’</title>

      <description>Analyst and author Mark Halperin told Fox News&amp;apos; Jesse Watters that donors are upset with President Biden for recent events, but they are partly to blame themselves.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Political analyst and best-selling author Mark Halperin said that President Biden’s presidential library may become more of a &quot;bookmobile&quot; as donors stew about his loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats are still reeling weeks later from the loss of the 2024 election to President-elect Donald Trump, as well as the more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/tapper-biden-lying-pardoning-hunter-makes-admin-allies-credulous-complicit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;recent blanket pardon of Biden’s son&lt;/a&gt; Hunter Biden. The pardon has been particularly controversial because Biden appears to have hidden his intention to pardon as a political tactic when running against Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, President Biden appears to have fallen from the Democratic Party’s good graces, to the point where some frustrated Democrats are reportedly considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/democrats-frustrated-hunter-pardon-consider-withholding-future-biden-presidential-library-donations-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;withholding donations&lt;/a&gt; to President Biden&apos;s future presidential library over his pardon of Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halperin suggested to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News’ Jesse Watters&lt;/a&gt; that Biden may not be getting a full-fledged library as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2-times-biden-said-he-would-not-pardon-son-hunter-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 TIMES BIDEN SAID HE WOULD NOT PARDON SON HUNTER BIDEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean there will be some version, maybe more like a bookmobile than an actual library,&quot; he told Watters. &quot;But this is not a surprise. He’s never been a good fundraiser and the donors are really annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halperin argued that the donors themselves, along with the liberal media, are partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I will say that the donors and the democratic officials who are now so outraged about the conduct – as you said, the press knew all this – so did they,&quot; he said. &quot;They stood silent when Joe Biden’s operatives crushed Bobby Kennedy and Dean Phillips and rigged the rules. They stood silent as he stayed in the race and decided he was going to run for another term. They stood silent when Kamala Harris was given the nomination without a shot being fired.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halperin suggested now might be a time of reflection for Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get why they are mad at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, but I think a lot of them need to turn the clock back and imagine what they might have done differently, and Joe Biden might be in a place to raise the money,&quot; he said. &quot;So I think he will raise some money, but as I said, he’s never been a good fundraiser, it’s the kind of work he doesn’t like to do and the donors blame him more than themselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-says-he-never-take-his-clemency-granted-after-receiving-pardon-from-his-father&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUNTER BIDEN SAYS HIS MISTAKES WERE ‘EXPLOITED’ FOR POLITICAL SPORT, SAYS HE WON&apos;T TAKE PARDON FOR GRANTED&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halperin argued that Biden’s purported mental decline has been obvious since 2017, but a combination of factors have shielded him from criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s some combination of Trump Derangement Syndrome and not wanting to be ostracized for doing anything that might help Donald Trump win,&quot; Halperin said. &quot;The irony is the reason Joe Biden has been left in the position he’s in, the reason Donald Trump was reelected, there are plenty of reasons, but a big reason is the silence in the media. I think it’s one of the biggest scandals of any sort in American history and certainly one of the biggest media scandals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued, &quot;People say ‘Oh, they didn’t see behind the scenes.’ All you needed was a C-SPAN subscription to know there was a level of mental decline, and they stood silent,&quot; he said. &quot;And not just the press, but the donors, the donors were spending time with him in living rooms. They saw it, Clooney eventually came out and said it, but far too late.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>MSNBC&apos;s Joe Scarborough unleashes on media still outraged over Trump meeting: &apos;Grow up!&apos;</title>

      <description>MSNBC&amp;apos;s Joe Scarborough blasted critics who remain upset about the meeting he and &amp;quot;Morning Joe&amp;quot; co-host Mika Brzezinski had with President-elect Donald Trump.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC&apos;s Joe Scarborough took aim at his liberal colleagues in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;legacy media&lt;/a&gt; over their ongoing outrage over the meeting he and his co-host Mika Brzezinski had last month with President-elect Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarborough kicked off Thursday&apos;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot; with a 20-minute response to a piece written by The Atlantic&apos;s David Frum, a frequent &quot;Morning Joe&quot; guest who suggested the MSNBC duo are now living in &quot;fear&quot; as Trump returns to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me tell you something, you can talk to anybody that&apos;s worked in the front office of NBC and MSNBC over the past 22 years tell you I&apos;m not fearful. You talk to anybody who served with me in Congress, they will tell you- not fearful of leadership. Now? Not fearful,&quot; Scarborough said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We went down to talk to the president-elect, and people wrote articles that were just false. But you know what we did? We did the corporate thing. Corporate said, &apos;Don&apos;t say anything. Just keep your head down.&apos; … We did that. We enjoyed our Thanksgiving. We&apos;re like, ‘Eh, you know what? People are upset with some of our guests, some of our friends. Maybe we snuck up on them too fast. Maybe we should have given them more of a warning. Whatever. It&apos;s fine.&apos; But guess what? The main complaint was that we called Donald Trump&apos;s rhetoric ‘fascist’ during the campaign. And then we went down to have an off-the-record comment with. Guess who else does that? The New York Times. The Washington Post.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-contributor-trashes-network-shreds-morning-joe-colleagues-trump-meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR TRASHES NETWORK, SHREDS ‘MORNING JOE’ COLLEAGUES OVER TRUMP MEETING: ‘THIS IS NOT WORKING’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know what? I even think folks from The Atlantic, I think, might be doing that,&quot; Brzezinski interjected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If they have a chance to talk on the background with the incoming president and president-elect, they would do it,&quot; Scarborough continued. &quot;In fact, as somebody wrote during this outrageously stupid, immature series of articles that lied time and time again about us, reporters said &apos;I&apos;d be fired if I had the opportunity to go in and talk to somebody who&apos;s the incoming president of the United States and I didn&apos;t do it.&apos; Ask any journalist at The New York Times and New York Post- and this is a funny thing. People at The Washington Post, especially, hair on fire! Media report, ‘how dare they, how dare they.’ At the same time that The Washington Post is doing the same thing, trying to speak to the president on background, trying to speak to people around the president on background. That&apos;s what reporters do!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/jon-stewart-skewers-morning-joe-co-hosts-trump-meeting-you-said-he-hitler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JON STEWERT SKEWERS ‘MORNING JOE’ CO-HOSTS FOR TRUMP MEETING: ‘YOU SAID HE WAS HITLER’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only difference between what we did on that visit and what The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, everybody else is doing is we were transparent. We actually told you,&quot; Scarborough later said. &quot;And so I understand if you don&apos;t know how the media works,day in and day out, and you&apos;re just like watching this show day in and day out, I&apos;d understand I would be like, ‘Wow, okay, man, man, that sudden.’ But for media reporters to lie, to pretend that this is a shock, to try to get [clicks], the Washington Post reporters and columnists saying ‘How dare they go see him after they said he was a fascist.’ And that&apos;s exactly what The Washington Post is doing. That&apos;s exactly what The Wall Street Journal is doing. That&apos;s exactly what The New York Times is doing. Yeah, you know what you call it? You call it their job.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarborough went on to argue that &quot;you can do two things at the same time,&quot; that he can still call Trump a &quot;fascist&quot; and go to talk to him in order to get &quot;the read of the man&quot; &quot;so I can come back here and talk to you and let you know what the hell is going on!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know, everybody we have on this show that&apos;s a reporter? It&apos;s what they do every day. They speak on background,&quot; Scarborough reiterated. He later said, &quot;I&apos;m sick and tired of the nonsense and I wish we&apos;d all just get to work, doing the things we need to do, which is our job, which is talking to people who are going to determine where this country goes over the next four years.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brzezinski denied that she and Scarborough&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/morning-joe-co-hosts-hold-face-to-face-meeting-trump-first-time-seven-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;private sit-down with Trump&lt;/a&gt; was not &quot;kissing the ring&quot; or &quot;bending the knee,&quot; insisting it was a &quot;serious meeting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberals-rage-against-morning-joe-betrayal-after-co-hosts-meet-trump-we-not-forgive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIBERALS RAGE AGAINST &apos;MORNING JOE&apos; &apos;BETRAYAL&apos; AFTER CO-HOSTS MEET WITH TRUMP: &apos;WE WILL NOT FORGIVE&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To those that you were talking about here who are still kind of pushing this narrative and saying this article is so sad and ‘Oh my God, fear has taken over.’ Good job. Good job,&quot; Brzezinski told their critics. &quot;Because you&apos;re so stuck in your hatred. You&apos;re so stuck in your hatred mode that you can&apos;t see that you are doing exactly what negative forces at play here want, which is causing us to fight. We should not be fighting for doing our jobs, for doing what The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, they are doing right now. And if they are not meeting with the president-elect and talking to him, then they are not doing their jobs. But we know they are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;CNN is doing it. Do we judge CNN for doing it? No. You know why? It&apos;s their jobs! Grow up! It&apos;s their jobs. The only thing we did that caused this Twitter storm is we told you. Now, if you prefer that we don&apos;t tell you everything that we do, that&apos;s fine. But we just saw it in this case, transparency was best,&quot; Scarborough added before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dust-up between Frum and the &quot;Morning Joe&quot; stars began Wednesday after Frum made a joke on their program about Fox News and Trump&apos;s Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, the former &quot;Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&quot; co-host. Brzezinski later told viewers Frum&apos;s comment was &quot;a little too flippant for the moment we&apos;re in.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Frum penned a piece titled &quot;The Sound of Fear on Air,&quot; calling Brzezinski&apos;s gentle rebuke of his quip an &quot;ominous sign&quot; as the country faces a second Trump presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a very ominous thing if our leading forums for discussion of public affairs are already feeling the chill of intimidation and responding with efforts to appease,&quot; Frum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/12/appeasement-new-age-trump/680871/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;told readers&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I write these words very aware that I’m probably saying goodbye forever to a television platform that I enjoy and from which I have benefited as both viewer and guest… I do not write to scold anyone; I write because fear is infectious. Let it spread, and it will paralyze us all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarborough made clear to viewers that Frum remains invited to &quot;Morning Joe&quot; and said Frum is expected to appear on Friday&apos;s program.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Packers head coach, Lions fan separated on field before rivalry game</title>

      <description>Before Thursday night&amp;apos;s NFC North clash between the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions, Matt LeFleur and a Detroit fan had to be separated on the field.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tempers flared early in Detroit ahead of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFC North matchup&lt;/a&gt; with an unusual dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/green-bay-packers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; head coach Matt LaFleur and a Detroit Lions fan were separated on the field before Thursday night’s clash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruckus appeared to occur right before the national anthem when Lions fans were on the field holding the flag for the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, though, a fan in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/detroit-lions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Brian Branch jersey&lt;/a&gt; took it a bit too far, to the point LaFleur told him to &quot;shut the f--- up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Packers players and referees intervened before the fan walked away, excited about what had just happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans holding the flag took their phones out to record the argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t an ideal start for the Packers once the game actually started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defensive penalty on a third and goal gave the Lions a fresh set of downs, and David Montgomery ran in for a score on the game’s first drive. After Detroit made it 10-0, the Packers cut into the lead with a Josh Jacobs touchdown in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions took a 17-7 lead into the locker room, but the Packers scored touchdowns on back-to-back drives and benefited from a costly Jared Goff interception to lead 21-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/former-ohio-state-star-cameron-heyward-pays-off-michigan-bet-brutal-way-i-feel-like-idiot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER OHIO STATE STAR CAMERON HEYWARD PAYS OFF MICHIGAN BET IN BRUTAL WAY: &apos;I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions and Packers have combined to go 20-4 this season and are first and third in the division, respectively. Detroit is looking to set a franchise record with its 11th straight victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both teams earned home victories on Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions defeated the Packers last month, 24-14, at Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trump taps former Sen. David Perdue as ambassador to China</title>

      <description></description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President-elect Trump&lt;/a&gt; has tapped former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., to serve as U.S. Ambassador to China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his announcement, Trump said Perdue &quot;brings valuable expertise to help build our relationship with China,&quot; citing his decades-long career in business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/trumps-proposed-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-increase-inflation-goldman-sachs-warns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP&apos;S PROPOSED TARIFFS ON MEXICO, CANADA, CHINA WILL INCREASE INFLATION, GOLDMAN SACHS WARNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;China’s leaders&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Trump said on Truth Social. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment comes amid threats by Trump to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-immigration-nominee-ur-jaddou-uscis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN USCIS NOMINEE CALLED FOR PAUSING BORDER PATROL FUNDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also appointed Brandon Judd, president of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Border Patrol Council&lt;/a&gt;, as ambassador to Chile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brandon helped me develop and implement the most effective Border Security policies in our Nation’s History,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I have also watched as Brandon tirelessly and honorably represented the Border Patrol Agents who elected him as their voice in all matters, especially in their efforts to secure our Great Country’s Borders, and keep all Americans safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am confident Brandon will represent the United States in the same manner as he represented all rank-and-file Border Patrol Agents as the President of the National Border Patrol Council. Brandon will do our Country proud!&quot; Trump added. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>JESSE WATTERS: The DOGE boys are about to crash the government&apos;s bloated, lazy and drunk bubble bath</title>

      <description>Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses President-elect Donald Trump&amp;apos;s plan to take a &amp;apos;blowtorch&amp;apos; to Washington, D.C. in his opening monologue.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s plan to take a &apos;blowtorch&apos; to Washington, D.C. and how the federal government has spiraled out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;Government has only gotten bigger. We&apos;re 36 trillion in debt, agencies are bloated and bureaucrats have never been lazier. Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation. But compared to the rest of the government, he&apos;s a workaholic. A new Senate report says only 6% of federal workers go into the office five days a week. And if you don&apos;t count security guards and maintenance staff, only 1% of government workers do 9 to 5 Monday through Friday. 1%. Almost 90% of government office buildings are completely empty. So where is everyone? One manager at Veterans Affairs took a picture of himself working from a bubble bath. He called it ‘my office for the next hour.’ What kind of man takes a bubble bath? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/were-democrats-biden-should-not-have-pardoned-hunter-now-he-should-pardon-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WE&apos;RE DEMOCRATS. BIDEN SHOULD NOT HAVE PARDONED HUNTER. NOW HE SHOULD PARDON TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That was until today. Trump finally got Elon out of Mar-a-Lago and sent him to Capitol Hill… Trump&apos;s taking a blowtorch to D.C. The goal is to cut 2 trillion from the budget. And if you&apos;re working from home, you&apos;re not working hard enough. So pack your bags… The two richest men in the world are going to streamline the government to run it like a corporation. And now the third-richest man wants in. Mark Zuckerberg just made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to talk shop with Trump. And everyone&apos;s on notice. Executives from big pharma companies like Pfizer flew down to Mar-a-Lago this week to have dinner with Trump. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chargers star Derwin James Jr. tosses Ladd McConkey&apos;s name in race for Rookie of the Year: &apos;Great pro&apos;</title>

      <description>Los Angeles Chargers star safety Derwin James Jr. wants rookie receiver Ladd McConkey to be in the Rookie of the Year conversation since he&amp;apos;s emerged as a top passing option out west.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many believe the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year race is between two players with five games remaining, but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/los-angeles-chargers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Chargers&lt;/a&gt; star safety made his own suggestion for a dark horse candidate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterbacks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jayden-daniels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jayden Daniels&lt;/a&gt; of the Washington Commanders and Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos are the frontrunners to win the regular-season award, but Derwin James Jr. wants rookie receiver Ladd McConkey added to the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We got Ladd McConkey. That’s the Rookie of the Year. Ladd McConkey at receiver,&quot; James said during an appearance on FanDuel TV’s &quot;Up &amp;amp; Adams&quot; with Kay Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James also shouted out his quarterback, Justin Herbert, rookie right tackle Joe Alt and left tackle Rashawn Slater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McConkey, who leads the team with 58 catches for 815 yards, has emerged as a true top receiver in Greg Roman’s offense in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James was asked why he believes McConkey has gotten his career off to a fast start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ladd’s a great pro,&quot; James responded. &quot;Every day he shows up to work, he’s got his priorities in line off the field. I feel like every day he wants to be great and give it all to the team. Love Ladd so much.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McConkey ranks second among rookies in receiving yards. Budding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/las-vegas-raiders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Las Vegas Raiders&lt;/a&gt; star Brock Bowers has 884 to lead the way. The tight end also leads all rookie receivers with 84 catches on 113 targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still games remaining, so maybe McConkey can top Bowers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the race will likely remain between Daniels and Nix considering they have led their teams to playoff contention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nix leads all NFL rookies with 2,842 passing yards, and Daniels is right behind him with 2,819. Nix has thrown 17 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Daniels has thrown 15 touchdowns and six picks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniels also has six rushing scores and 590 yards on the ground. Nix has rushed for 304 yards and four touchdowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Fetterman hits party&apos;s losses among young male voters: &apos;It&apos;s undeniable that Democrats have lost a lot&apos;</title>

      <description>Sen. John Fetterman said it&amp;apos;s expected that men found an alternative with Republicans after the way Democrats spoke to them during the 2024 election.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Democratic Senator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/john-fetterman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John Fetterman&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania doubled down on his comments criticizing his party over their 2024 election losses, specifically among men, during an appearance on &quot;The View&quot; Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The View&quot; co-hosts pressed Fetterman on his previous comments in which he bluntly told his fellow Democrats they lost male voters to President-elect Donald Trump because they were &quot;condescending&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It forces men to kind of choose, can I really remain a Democrat?&quot; he said. &quot;The tone in those kinds of situations, it&apos;s undeniable. I&apos;ve witnessed that over the last eight years … and here we are now and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-fetterman-calls-trump-victory-serious-flex-bros-theyre-not-fascists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;whether it&apos;s ‘bros’ or the ‘manosphere’&lt;/a&gt; and I mean clearly, those are negative kinds of terms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/outgoing-dnc-chair-defends-party-says-2024-could-have-been-worth-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OUTGOING DNC CHAIR DEFENDS PARTY, SAYS 2024 COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE FOR DEMOCRATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you talk down with them, or you make them part of the problem, or it&apos;s all because of you and your fault, then of course, they&apos;re going to find an alternative,&quot; he added. &quot;And that&apos;s what they&apos;ve done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetterman said it&apos;s &quot;undeniable&quot; that Democrats have lost ground with men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not sure we&apos;re able to bring that back without a long-term kind of strategy to reengage them, because it&apos;s undeniable there&apos;s been serious erosion,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fetterman told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/us/politics/john-fetterman-democrats.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; last month that the party&apos;s condescension toward male voters had alienated a major bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/women-engage-mass-primal-scream-wake-trump-victory-release-our-pain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOMEN ENGAGE IN MASS ‘PRIMAL SCREAM’ IN WAKE OF TRUMP VICTORY: ‘RELEASE OUR PAIN’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 2016, I was doing an event with the steel workers, across the street where I live, and I was noticing different kind of energy with this, with Trump. It was clear at that time that people were voting for Trump. And the Democrats’ response was, ‘Aren’t they smart enough to realize they’re voting against their interests?’ And that’s insulting, and … that’s just not helpful. It’s condescending. And if anything, that reinforces that kind of stereotype,&quot; he told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Telling them that &apos;I know better than you do,&apos; that’s not helpful,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-berates-democrats-freaking-out-over-trump-victory-just-grab-grip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;also warned his party&lt;/a&gt; that they need to stop their pearl-clutching over Trump&apos;s win, adding that the outrage from Democrats &quot;has to be candy for Trump.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re not even at Thanksgiving, and Democrats just can’t stop losing our minds every 15 minutes. We really need to pace ourselves, or, you know, FFS [for f---&apos;s sake], just grab a grip,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Newsom rails against Trump&apos;s 25% tariff plan during southern border visit: &apos;It&apos;s a betrayal&apos;</title>

      <description>Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Trump&amp;apos;s proposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, warning of harm to Californians as he prepares to &amp;apos;Trump-proof&amp;apos; state.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt; railed against President-Elect Trump&apos;s proposal to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada during a visit to the southern border to announce plans to finish constructing the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry on Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom described &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-canada-become-51st-state-after-trudeau-said-tariff-would-kill-economy-sources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the tariffs&lt;/a&gt; as &quot;one of the biggest tax increases in U.S. history&quot; that would affect Californians&apos; wallets and small businesses, especially farmers across the Golden State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t think for a second this won&apos;t impact you,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Newsom said&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;90% of these tariffs will impact bottom of our economic chain, meaning lower wage workers that pay over half of these taxes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-proposes-25m-from-state-legislature-trump-proof-california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEWSOM PROPOSES $25M FROM STATE LEGISLATURE TO ‘TRUMP-PROOF’ CALIFORNIA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no economic growth in America without the success and the vibrancy of this region,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling the tariffs a &quot;betrayal&quot; that is &quot;happening in real time,&quot; Newsom said the new legal crossing would promote two-way trade between Mexico and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are being betrayed by these policies,&quot; Newsom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And those farmers and ranchers will be impacted disproportionately if these tariffs go into effect,&quot; he said. &quot;And I didn&apos;t even bring up the mass deportation components of it. You know better than I do when you look at farm workers, the last estimate, roughly half &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;are undocumented.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In talking about the Ota Mesa Easy Port of Entry, Newsom said he hopes to have it completed by December 2027, with the help of the incoming Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/californias-unemployment-benefits-system-broken-20b-owed-feds-loan-debt-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CALIFORNIA&apos;S UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SYSTEM ‘BROKEN’ WITH $20B OWED TO FEDS IN LOAN DEBT: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We care about border security, but we also care about economic security, and we care about two way trade, and we care about our partners on the other side of this border that have well-established partnerships.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom also announced a new plan with the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; California National Guard&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen border security by targeting the flow of fentanyl and illegal weapons. Nearly 200,000 illegal migrants cross the border into California daily through ports of entry, according to the San Diego-based Smart Border Coalition in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is part of Newsom&apos;s effort to reframe the conversation around illegal immigration flowing into the blue state as he positions himself for a potential showdown with the incoming Trump administration. This week, Newsom spearheaded an emergency special legislative session, urging lawmakers to approve $25 million to bolster the state&apos;s legal defense against potential federal lawsuits lobbed by Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/prop-36-overwhelmingly-passes-california-reversing-some-soros-backed-soft-on-crime-policies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PROPOSITION 36 OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES IN CALIFORNIA, REVERSING SOME SOROS-BACKED SOFT-ON-CRIME POLICIES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2017 and 2021, California&apos;s Department of Justice &lt;a href=&quot;https://noticias.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;led 122 lawsuits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against Trump administration policies, spending $42 million on litigation. Newsom&apos;s office said in one case, the federal government was ordered to reimburse California nearly $60 million in public safety grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While California filed over 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration, President-elect Donald Trump lobbed only four major lawsuits against the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;abortion procedures&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and transgender transition treatments for children, could be targeted by the Trump administration, especially considering Trump&apos;s mass deportation plan of illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump called Newsom&apos;s plan an effort to &quot;Trump-proof&quot; the state in a Truth social post last month.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>A suspect who fatally shot the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on Wednesday morning rode a Greyhound bus from Atlanta to New York City last month, sources say.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The man suspected of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-assassin-left-message-behind-make-statement-throw-off-police-detectives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan on Wednesday morning arrived in New York City last month via a Greyhound bus from Atlanta, law enforcement sources told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooter boarded a bus in Atlanta the day before Thanksgiving, sources within the New York Police Department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Thompson was gunned down by the suspect before 7 a.m. Wednesday outside of the Hilton in Midtown Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompsons-killer-used-fake-id-check-nyc-hostel-before-slaying-sources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED HEALTHCARE CEO BRIAN THOMPSON&apos;S KILLER USED TO FAKE ID TO CHECK INTO NYC HOSTEL BEFORE SLAYING: SOURCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are fully cooperating with authorities on this active investigation. As it is ongoing, we cannot provide further comment at this time,&quot; a Greyhound spokesperson told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police sources told Fox News the suspect dropped a burner phone in an alley after the shooting. Police are looking into data that was on the phone, as well as fingerprints that were left on the device, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-us/slain-unitedhealthcare-ceo-wife-company-boss-break-silence-after-executive-murdered-outside-hotel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SLAIN UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO&apos;S WIFE, COMPANY BOSS BREAK SILENCE AFTER EXECUTIVE MURDERED OUTSIDE HOTEL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are also looking into a water bottle that was left at a Starbucks near the scene of the murder. Police sources say that DNA from the bottle is being used to build a suspect profile. The suspect is said to have paid in cash at the Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former NYPD inspector and Fox News Contributor Paul Mauro said the type of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-nypd-inspector-skeptical-unitedhealthcare-ceo-gunman-professional-zeroes-weapon-choice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; possibly rare weapon&lt;/a&gt; used by the gunman could work to police&apos;s advantage, and addressed rumors the suspect may have worked as a hitman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The speculation is that it&apos;s a hit man, it&apos;s a professional killer and all this sort of stuff…I would just hesitate on that and tell people to just be mindful of the fact that professional hitmen primarily exist in the movies. They don&apos;t really exist,&quot; Mauro told Fox News Digital. Mauro says everything we know at this point is just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In video obtained by Fox News Digital, Thompson is seen walking down a sidewalk outside the Hilton early Wednesday morning when the masked suspect&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; guns him down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before fleeing the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional surveillance videos obtained by Fox News Digital from a deli near where Thompson was killed appear to show his killer walking toward the hotel where he was shot that morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The videos show a person with the same build and wearing the same clothing as the suspect walking down 55th Street at 6:19 a.m. toward the Hilton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspect also used a fake ID to check into a hostel before the shooting, police sources told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NYPD source also told Fox News Digital that messages etched onto bullet casings by the suspect were &quot;left behind to make a statement.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police sources &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2024/12/05/us-news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompsons-assassin-may-have-left-message-on-bullets-used-in-murder-sources/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told the New York Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the words &quot;deny,&quot; &quot;depose&quot; and &quot;defend&quot; were written on the live rounds and casings left behind by the assassin after the shooting. Each bullet and casing had just one word written on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Lorraine Taylor, Ashley Papa and Christina Coulter contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>LAURA INGRAHAM: The porn industry has been free to profit off selling toxic material to minors</title>

      <description>Fox News host Laura Ingraham calls out the porn industry for &amp;quot;profiting off selling its toxic material to minors,&amp;quot; causing &amp;quot;devastating&amp;quot; effects on &amp;quot;The Ingraham Angle.&amp;quot;</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Laura Ingraham exposes the harmful impact of the &quot;toxic&quot; porn industry on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Ingraham Angle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAURA INGRAHAM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Although stores aren&apos;t legally allowed to sell kids cigarettes or booze without seeing an ID, somehow the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/laws-protecting-children-porn-sites-winning-some-states-activists-push-nationwide-solution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;porn industry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has been free to profit off selling its toxic material to minors. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The consequences for both young women and men who can access this have been devastating. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/porn-industry-fuels-sex-trafficking-increases-demand-children-rescue-experts-warn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE PORN INDUSTRY FUELS SEX TRAFFICKING, INCREASES THE DEMAND FOR CHILDREN: RESCUE EXPERTS WARN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last spring, the New York Times described &quot;how to&quot; articles around the internet and social media algorithms that feed young people, but typically not their unsuspecting parents, hundreds of &quot;#ChokeMeDaddy&quot; memes along with memes that mock and even celebrate the potential for hurting or killing female partners. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The same elites who pretend to care so much about girls are culpable as well.

      <title>Former Ohio State star Cameron Heyward pays off Michigan bet in brutal way: &apos;I feel like an idiot&apos;</title>

      <description>Former Ohio State Buckeye Cameron Heyward lost a bet to Michigan alum Roman Wilson and had to wear a Wolverines hat while meeting with reporters.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ohio State alum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cameron-heyward&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Cameron Heyward&lt;/a&gt; placed a bet on last week&apos;s Ohio State-Michigan game, which his Buckeyes lost, 13-10, in one of the biggest upsets of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upset was not enough to keep the Buckeyes out of the College Football Playoff, but Heyward likely wasn&apos;t concerned about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While talking with reporters this week, Heyward reluctantly wore a Michigan hat to settle his wager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veteran and Pittsburgh Steelers rookie teammate Roman Wilson, who played a big role in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/michigan-wolverines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Wolverines&apos; national championship&lt;/a&gt; last year, made the bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was terrible,&quot; Heyward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse was the bet was Heyward&apos;s idea, which is understandable considering the Buckeyes were three-touchdown favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/bill-belichick-interviews-college-football-job-after-legendary-coach-leaves-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BILL BELICHICK INTERVIEWS FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL JOB AFTER LEGENDARY COACH LEAVES: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I approached him, so I feel like an idiot,&quot; Heyward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s just hope Wilson and Heyward didn&apos;t come to blows like the players on the field in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the game, Michigan players tried to plant a UM flag at midfield, which many Buckeyes took exception to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident resulted in a brawl between the two teams, and police used pepper spray to settle the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a storybook ending for what was a disappointing Wolverines season, who finished 7-5. The bright side for OSU is it is still fighting for a national championship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>New Jersey leaders speak to DHS as unusual drone sightings now also reported over New York</title>

      <description>New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy spoke with federal and state officials about the sightings of drones in recent weeks, but said there was no threat to the public.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said he spoke with state and federal officials about unusual drone activity in parts of the region, including the vicinity of President-elect Trump&apos;s Bedminster golf club, but stressed there was no threat to public safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Thursday post on X, Murphy said he convened a briefing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, senior officials from DHS, the state police and state Homeland Security and Preparedness, as well as New Jersey&apos;s congressional delegation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,&quot; he wrote. &quot;There is no known threat to the public at this time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, drones were spotted flying in Somerset and Morris counties. In a video from Nov. 25, a Morris County resident named Mike Walsh spotted drones flying over Black River Middle School in Chester. The Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster is located in Somerset County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-spurs-officials-draft-vip-security-plan-bedminster-amid-heightened-politica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW JERSEY OFFICIALS DRAFT VIP SECURITY PLAN AT BEDMINISTER AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other drone sightings in the Garden State occurred in Bernardsville, Mendham and Parsippany. In response to unusual drone sightings above the northern and central New Jersey skies on Nov. 18, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday confirmed it had issued two temporary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;flight restrictions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One involves the airspace above the Trump property and is in place until the end of this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the request of federal security partners, the FAA published two temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) prohibiting drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Military Base&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster,&quot; the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Tom Kean, R-N.J., was on Wednesday&apos;s call with Murphy, Mayorkas and other government and law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will continue to push federal authorities to work swiftly to give the public a full understanding of the situation and work toward a resolution,&quot; he wrote Thursday on X. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-organization-flames-reports-nj-might-pull-liquor-licenses-after-conviction-he-is-not-holder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLASHBACK: TRUMP ORG BLASTS REPORTS NJ MAY PULL LIQUOR LICENSES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, New Jersey state Sen. Anthony Bucco, a Republican, said some of the drones flew over his home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have been assured that there is no known imminent threat from these devices,&quot; he said. &quot;Our law enforcement community, including the FBI, continues to gather information on the drones and provide information to the public as it becomes available.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Rebecca &quot;Mikie&quot; Sherrill, D-N.J., said she would remain in close contact with the investigation and would share updates as they come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vito Fossella, president of Staten Island, is asking the FBI to expand its probe into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/air-and-space&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;drone sightings&lt;/a&gt; to include the airspace over his New York City borough. In one instance, drone flights prevented a medevac helicopter from being able to transport a seriously injured crash victim in Branchburg Township, New Jersey, to the hospital, Fossella said in a letter to the law enforcement agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It stands to question, what else could these drones be impacting?&quot; Fossella said. &quot;Staten Island is home to two hospital systems, and the potential for these drones to impede life-saving care in medical emergencies is deeply concerning.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Andrea Margolis contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bernie Sanders embraces Canada joining the US as the 51st state after Trump reportedly suggested the idea</title>

      <description>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on Tuesday that he is open to the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state after President-elect Donald Trump suggested that idea to the Canadian prime minister.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on Tuesday that he is open to the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;President-elect Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the country could join the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trump has suggested that Canada become the 51st state in our union,&quot; Sanders wrote. &quot;Does that mean that we can adopt the Canadian health care system and guarantee health care to all, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and spend 50% less per capita on health care?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m all for it,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-boasts-very-productive-meeting-canadian-pm-trudeau-mar-a-lago&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP BOASTS OF ‘VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING’ WITH CANADIAN PM TRUDEAU AT MAR-A-LAGO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders is a staunch supporter of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/medicare-for-all-sen-bernie-sanders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;universal public health care&lt;/a&gt; and a critic of the U.S. healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry. He has often cited universal healthcare systems working in other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;the lawmaker proposed&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;Medicare for All, single-payer, national health insurance program&quot; to provide all Americans with free health care coverage at the point of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexican-president-might-changing-view-us-trump-win-sends-warning-ruling-socialists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEXICAN PRESIDENT MIGHT BE CHANGING VIEW ON US AS TRUMP WIN SENDS WARNING TO RULING SOCIALISTS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago unannounced after Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products. Specifically, Trump is threatening to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico over their failures to curb the flow of illegal immigrants and illicit drugs from those countries into the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/justin-trudeau&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trudeau told Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he cannot levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy completely. Trump replied – asking, so your country can&apos;t survive unless it&apos;s ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump then suggested to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trudeau that Canada&lt;/a&gt; become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, sources told Fox News. But he continued, telling Trudeau that prime minister is a better title, though he could still be governor of the 51st state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Fox News someone at the table chimed in and advised Trump that Canada would be a very liberal state, which received even more laughter. Trump suggested that Canada could possibly become two states: a conservative and a liberal one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Actress dies after consuming amphibian&apos;s venom at spiritual cleansing retreat</title>

      <description>Mexican actress Marcela Alcázar Rodríguez, 33, died after ingesting Amazonian frog venom during a cleansing ritual at a spiritual retreat.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Mexican actress&lt;/a&gt; is dead after voluntarily participating in a spiritual cleansing ritual during which she reportedly consumed poisonous Amazonian frog venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcela Alcázar Rodríguez, 33, took some of the poison as part of a spiritual cleansing return that some South American natives have used for toxic cleansing, according to local reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodríguez started throwing up and had severe diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She first refused help while feeling ill but eventually gave in when her friend visited and her condition worsened, witnesses said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6353247454112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALLIGATOR DOES DEATH ROLL WHILE NORTH CAROLINA COPS WRANGLE HIM IN: ‘HE’S GROWLING&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican production company Mapache Films &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/departed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;confirmed the death&lt;/a&gt;, saying she was a &quot;beloved colleague and friend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With deep regret, we mourn the death of our beloved colleague and friend, Marcela Alcázar Rodríguez,&quot; the production company wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DDDzUKYsTu2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6345966271112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AUSTRALIAN GIRL SAVES PET GUINEA PIG FROM SNAKE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Her passing left an immense emptiness in our hearts and in our professional community. Her dedication, joy and commitment left a profound mark on all of us who had the privilege of working beside her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kambo is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/south-america&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; healing ritual that incorporates the poisonous secretions of a frog, according to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The frog secretes the substance as a defense mechanism to kill or subdue animals that try to eat it. Some humans, on the other hand, apply the substance to their body for its alleged health benefits,&quot; the outlet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are investigating a shaman’s involvement in the incident.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ohio sisters raise thousands to help senior veterans take part in Honor Flights: &apos;We love our veterans&apos;</title>

      <description>Sisters Tessa and Raya Ziegler join &amp;apos;America&amp;apos;s Newsroom&amp;apos; with their mother to share their efforts to support the nation&amp;apos;s veterans.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A pair of sisters from southwestern Ohio are giving back to America&apos;s veterans in a huge way by collecting thousands of dollars for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honorflight.org/donate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Honor Flights&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-year-old Tessa Ziegler and eight-year-old Raya Ziegler raised more than $30,000&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;to help the Honor Flight Network, which flies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365254743112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;veterans to Washington, D.C.,&lt;/a&gt; where they visit memorials that honor their sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love seeing the veterans and their smiles after they get home from the Honor Flight,&quot; Tessa said on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/americas-newsroom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;America&apos;s Newsroom&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/forgotten-civil-war-veteran-finally-get-proper-tombstone-thanks-two-middle-school-students&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORGOTTEN CIVIL WAR VETERAN WILL FINALLY GET PROPER TOMBSTONE, THANKS TO TWO MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older sister said the duo were inspired to join the cause after riding along for an Honor Flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My mom inspired me because her friend invited us to an Honor Flight and we just really liked it, and we just wanted to keep going back there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raya told co-anchor Bill Hemmer she was inspired to help at such a young age &quot;because I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6365091800112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;our veterans,&lt;/a&gt; because they&apos;re so nice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Ziegler, mom of the two fundraising sisters, said it is an &quot;honor&quot; to be helping support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/gary-sinise-foundation-building-company-present-free-home-wounded-army-veteran&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;America&apos;s veterans&lt;/a&gt; through the Honor Flights Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We just love our veterans here. And we know most of the veterans right now on the Honor Flights are Vietnam veterans, Korean. We know that they had no homecoming at all. A lot of them were spit on. People tried to fight them,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So to be there at these Honor Flight homecomings and be able to welcome them home and give them the homecoming that they truly deserved – shake their hands, thank them for their service – it just gets really emotional. They&apos;re happy. They&apos;re crying. It&apos;s just such a great program.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To join the Zieglers in giving back to America&apos;s heroes, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.honorflighttristate.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;www.honorflighttristate.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ex-WaPo reporter doubles down on post wanting health insurance executives dead: &apos;It&apos;s natural to wish&apos;</title>

      <description>Ex-Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz doubled down on her harsh comments appearing to celebrate UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s murder in a Substack post.</description>


      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz doubled down Thursday on her shocking comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-wapo-reporter-says-we-want-executives-dead-after-murder-health-insurance-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;appearing to celebrate&lt;/a&gt; the reportedly targeted murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/shocking-video-shows-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-gunned-down-nyc-street&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;chilling video&lt;/a&gt; released Wednesday showed Thompson being shot and killed at close range while outside the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York. The suspect is still at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after news broke of his death, Lorenz wrote on the social media site Bluesky, &quot;And people wonder why we want these executives dead,&quot; alongside a report about Blue Cross Blue Shield no longer covering anesthesia for the full length of some surgeries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz went on to share images of Blue Cross Blue Shield CEO Kim Keck and reposted calls for other health insurance executives to be targeted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/who-brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO WAS BRIAN THOMPSON, UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After facing backlash for her post about dead execs, Lorenz defended herself in comments to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-wapo-reporter-says-we-want-executives-dead-after-murder-health-insurance-ceo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/a&gt;, then in a lengthy screed posted to her Substack the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usermag.co/p/yes-we-want-insurance-executives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;In a post&lt;/a&gt; entitled, &quot;Why ‘we’ want insurance executives dead,&quot; Lorenz denied she was calling for the murder of more top executives before seeming to justify her harsh comments from the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me be super clear: my post uses a collective ‘we’ and is explaining the public sentiment. It is not me personally saying ‘I want these executives dead and so we should kill them,&apos;&quot; Lorenz said. &quot;I am explaining that thousands of Americans (myself included) are fed up with our barbaric healthcare system and the people at the top who rake in millions while inflicting pain, suffering, and death on millions of innocent people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;If you have watched a loved one die because an insurance conglomerate has denied their life saving treatment as a cost cutting measure, yes, it&apos;s natural to wish that the people who run such conglomerates would suffer the same fate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post also featured the meme of a celebratory image of a smiling star and balloons with the text, &quot;CEO DOWN.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-posts-taylor-lorenz-says-biden-war-criminal-post-obvious-meme-after-claiming-edited&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WASHINGTON POST&apos;S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS BIDEN &apos;WAR CRIMINAL&apos; POST WAS &apos;OBVIOUS MEME&apos; AFTER CLAIMING IT WAS EDITED&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People have very justified hatred toward insurance company CEOs because these executives are responsible for an unfathomable amount of death and suffering. I think it’s good to call out this broken system and the people in power who enable it. Again, not so they can be murdered, but so that we can change the system and start holding people in power accountable for their actions,&quot; her post went on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz argued that while some online commentary has gone too far and promoted violence, the media had failed to examine &quot;the systemic cruelty of our health care system&quot; which motivated these sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued to retweet social media posts comparing Thompson to a mass murderer on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brian Thompson killed more US citizens than every serial killer combined, but because he made money off it the media considered him a successful businessman and morally upstanding citizen,&quot; one post read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/taylor-lorenz-leaves-washington-post-following-biden-war-criminal-controversy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;left The Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October and launched her User Magazine Substack. The far-left writer also had a past stint at the New York Times and has been embroiled in several online controversies over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for her extreme fears of COVID-19, &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1863724931554619437&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;she went viral&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week when she fretted that people not wearing masks in 2024 were &quot;raw-dogging the air.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
