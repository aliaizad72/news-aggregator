                            <p><strong>Trump’s pick for intelligence chief reportedly got her news from the Russian site even after Washington branded it ‘propaganda’</strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p>Former Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard has in the past been an avid reader of RT news and continued to follow the site long after the US government declared the network a Russian propaganda outlet, ABC News reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The article argued that this makes the politician unsuitable for the role of director of national intelligence in the incoming administration of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The president-elect announced in mid-November that he wants Gabbard to take the top intelligence position, causing outrage among establishment officials, who branded the pick a major security threat.</p>
<p>Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/607742-gabbard-trump-russian-asset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> Gabbard a <em>&ldquo;likely a Russian asset,&rdquo;</em> mirroring smears that the former Democratic Party member has endured for years. Hillary Clinton infamously claimed in 2019 that Moscow <em>&ldquo;groomed&rdquo;</em> Gabard to run in the 2020 primary election, predicting that she would run as an independent later in that cycle. However, Gabbard endorsed Joe Biden, and dropped out of the race.</p>
<p>ABC News suggested that Gabbard&rsquo;s foreign policy positions <em>&ldquo;have been shaped not by some covert intelligence recruitment&hellip; but instead by her unorthodox media consumption habits.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Anonymous aides told the outlet that their former boss <em>&ldquo;regularly read and shared articles from the Russian news site RT&rdquo;</em> and disregarded the fact that in 2017 the US branded it <em>&ldquo;the Kremlin&rsquo;s principal international propaganda outlet.&rdquo;</em> ABC News added that <em>&ldquo;it was not clear to those former staffers whether or when she stopped frequenting the site.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Gabbard, who served in the National Guard and is currently in the Army Reserve, has criticized the &lsquo;forever wars&rsquo; that the US has been embroiled in over the years. She has argued that such conflicts do not serve American interests.</p>
<p>While initially supporting Joe Biden&rsquo;s handling of the Ukraine conflict, she later grew sceptical of the policy. That shift <em>&ldquo;has most galvanized her critics in the national security sphere,&rdquo;</em> ABC News said.</p>
<p>The politician left the Democratic Party in 2022 and remained independent for two years. In October, she announced that she had joined the Republican Party, at a rally for Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A Ukrainian incursion has been underway in parts of the Russian border region since early August</strong></p>


            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed long-serving MP Aleksandr Khinshtein as the acting governor of the Kursk Region, where a Ukrainian incursion is ongoing.</p>
<p>The relevant decree was published on the presidential website on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Shortly before that, Putin offered the position of acting governor to Khinshtein during a meeting at the Kremlin.</p>
<p><em>"Crisis management is now in demand&rdquo;</em> in Kursk Region, the president said. <em>&ldquo;And as the territory is being liberated from the enemy, of course, a lot will need to be done to restore housing and communal services, to restore the economy of this territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Providing assistance to residents of the region is of utmost importance, he added.</p>
<p>Putin also noted that Khinshtein&rsquo;s experience as an adviser to the commander of Russia&rsquo;s National Guard between 2016 and 2018 should help him in his new position.</p>
<p>Khinshtein accepted the role, describing it as a great honor. He said he understood that the situation in the Kursk Region was <em>&ldquo;complicated.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;This is our land, and, of course, we must do everything to make sure that all residents of Kursk Region feel that they are part of our one big country,&rdquo;</em> the 50-year-old MP stated.</p>
<p>Khinshtein is a former investigative journalist. He has been a deputy of the Russian State Duma since 2003 and joined the ruling United Russia party in 2007. For the past four years, he has headed the parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology and Communications.</p>
<p><em>"I am heading out to the Kursk Region soon and starting work. I serve Russia! Victory will be ours!&rdquo;</em> Khinshtein wrote on Telegram on Friday.</p>
<p>The previous governor of Kursk, Aleksey Smirnov, announced his resignation on Thursday, saying he would be moving to another position.</p>
<p>Ukrainian troops invaded Kursk Region on August 6 in the largest attack on internationally recognized Russian territory since the escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. The area under the control of Ukrainian forces has been steadily shrinking in recent months, but they still maintain a presence in some parts of the region.</p>

                            <p><strong>The president is the source of the political chaos in the country, Thierry Mariani has claimed</strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron should resign if he has self-respect and wants what is best for the country, MEP Thierry Mariani has told RT.</p>
<p>This week, Macron accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, who was forced out of office by a parliamentary vote of no confidence. The president was able to appoint him in September despite his party&rsquo;s loss in a snap general election over the summer.</p>
<p>Barnier is the third French prime minister to have lost his job this year, and <em>&ldquo;little by little, all the French realize that the solution for this situation is not changing the prime minister,&rdquo;</em> Mariani said.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;The only problem is the president himself,&rdquo;</em> the lawmaker, who previously served in the French national parliament and in the cabinet during Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s presidency, told RT.</p>
<p></p>

        frameborder="0"></iframe>




<p></p>
<p>Amid the crisis, Macron has declared that he will stay in office for the rest of his term, which expires in 2027. Legally speaking, there is very little the parliament could do to make him go, Mariani said. But historic precedent favors an early resignation, he pointed out, citing the example of Charles de Gaulle, who refused to remain president after a political reform that he proposed was rejected during a referendum in 1958.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If Emmanuel Macron wants to serve France best, he should resign,&rdquo;</em> the politician urged. <em>&ldquo;If he has just a little respect for himself, he should go.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Able refugees should also be brought back from abroad to fight for Kiev, Ben Hodges has said</strong></p>


            <p>Ukraine should consider drafting women and lowering the mobilization age to 18 to boost its chances in the conflict with Russia, Ben Hodges, a former commander of US Army in Europe, has argued. Kiev lowered the conscription age to 25 earlier this year.</p>
<p>The former general&rsquo;s statement follows multiple reports in the mainstream media of Ukraine&rsquo;s severe manpower shortages, stemming from mounting losses on the frontline of the conflict with Russia.</p>
<p>To bolster the mobilization drive, Ukraine&nbsp;should draft younger people, Hodges told Ukrainian news outlet hromadske.ua in an interview published on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In my opinion, the conscription age in Ukraine is too high. In most countries of the world, you can join the military at the age of 18 or 19. Ukraine could also use this opportunity,&rdquo;</em> the former general said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I also think that there is enough work for women in the army. We need to engage women in military service more actively,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>

<p>Hodges also noted that Ukrainians living abroad have no business sitting the conflict out.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I live in Germany, and there are many Ukrainians here, I see them everywhere. This is not right. Only those who cannot help Ukraine fight should be here,&rdquo; </em>he said.</p>
<p>UN data suggests that as many as 6.8 million Ukrainians are living abroad, having fled the country since the conflict escalated in 2022.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken similarly said that Kiev needs to get younger people onto the front line, in an interview&nbsp;with Reuters on Wednesday. <em>&ldquo;Right now, 18 to 25-year olds are not in the fight,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s flagging mobilization drive is reportedly further exacerbated by high desertion rates. According to an article in the Financial Times last week, Ukrainian authorities opened at least 60,000 criminal cases against deserters between January and October of this year.</p>
<p>The actual number of desertions since 2022 could be as high as 200,000, the Associated Press wrote last week, citing a Ukrainian lawmaker with knowledge of military matters.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly slammed Kiev&rsquo;s NATO backers as pushing the country into a war <em>&ldquo;to the last Ukrainian.&rdquo;</em> Russia views the conflict as a proxy war waged by the US and its allies against Russia via Ukraine.</p>]]>

            <p>Tesla Cybertrucks have proven unfit for use in warfare, the leader of Russia&rsquo;s Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Thursday.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We sent it to war, installed a machine gun, but it was useless for war. Our Patriot is better in the war than this car,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Kadyrov added that he likes to joke around with Musk online.</p>

                            <p><strong>Independent politician Calin Georgescu has pulled ahead in the Romanian electoral race, as a staunch opponent of arming Kiev</strong></p>


            <p>Nationalist politician Calin Georgescu, considered the frontrunner in Romania's presidential race, has promised to end all military aid for Ukraine&nbsp;and put his people first.</p>
<p>The candidate clinched a surprise win in the first round of the Romanian election in November with 22.94% of the ballots, beating out liberal leftist candidate Elena Lasconi, who received 19.18%. The two will compete in&nbsp;a runoff on Sunday.</p>
<p>Georgescu, a religious nationalist, campaigned as an independent candidate on curtailing Romania&rsquo;s reliance on imports, boosting domestic production and criticizing Bucharest&rsquo;s role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>He promised to end all military and political assistance to Kiev if elected in the runoff, speaking to the BBC on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I have to take care of my people. I don&rsquo;t want to involve my people,&rdquo;</em> Georgescu said when asked if he would support Ukraine as long as it takes for it to win.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Zero. Everything stops. I have to take care just about my people. We have a lot of problems ourselves.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BBC said Georgescu, who is a former soil scientist, praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and US President-elect Donald Trump, who was reelected last month and has made similar promises to cut back spending on Ukraine and focus on domestic problems. While Georgescu praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a <em>&ldquo;patriot and a leader,&rdquo;</em> the Romanian frontrunner remarked that he is <em>&ldquo;not a fan.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Georgescu dismissed recent allegations of foreign collusion in his campaign, saying that his detractors <em>&ldquo;can't accept that the Romanian people finally said, 'we want our life back&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The accusations state that the independent politician&rsquo;s popularity was helped by a&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;state actor&rdquo;</em> meddling in his mostly Tik-Tok based campaign, helping to get his message out to the voters.</p>
<p>Tik-Tok has said claims that Georgescu&rsquo;s social media account was given preferential treatment are <em>&ldquo;categorically false.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Kremlin has denied Romanian accusations of Russian interference, slamming them as part of a <em>&ldquo;basic trend&rdquo;</em> in the West.</p>
<p>Should the candidate win on Sunday, it would herald a notable change in Bucharest&rsquo;s position on supporting Kiev. Romania has provided Ukraine with more than &euro;1.1 billion ($1.18 billion) in mostly military aid, including a costly US-produced Patriot air defense system, according to Germany&rsquo;s Kiel Institute.</p>

                            <p><strong>Moscow is working with Ankara and Tehran to stabilize the situation, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said</strong></p>


            <p>Russia has reports that the US and the UK might be implicated in supporting the al-Qaeda-affiliated militants currently on the offensive in Syria, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.</p>
<p>Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group, previously known as Jabhat al-Nusra, launched a surprise attack from Idlib last week and has since taken Aleppo and Hama. US journalist Tucker Carlson asked Lavrov who was supporting the terrorists in Syria, during the interview that aired on Thursday.</p>
<p>&rdquo;Well, we have some information,&rdquo; Lavrov said. <em>&ldquo;The information which is being floated and it&rsquo;s in the public domain, mentions, among others, the Americans, the Brits. Some people say that Israel is interested in making this situation aggravated so that Gaza is not under very close scrutiny.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complicated game. Many actors are involved,&rdquo;</em> the Russian diplomat added.</p>
<p>Lavrov explained to Carlson that Russia, Iran, and T&uuml;rkiye brokered a ceasefire in Syria in 2017 and again in 2020, calling this Astana Format <em>&ldquo;a useful combination of players.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The rules of the game are to help Syrians to come to terms with each other and to prevent separatist threats from getting strong,&rdquo;</em> the diplomat said. <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the Americans are doing in the east of Syria when they groom some Kurdish separatists using the profits from oil and grain sold, the resources which they occupy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We would like to discuss with all our partners in this process the way to cut the channels of financing and arming&rdquo;</em> the terrorists, he added.</p>
<p>Lavrov has already spoken with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues, he told Carlson, and intends to meet with them again on Friday at a conference in Qatar. Russia will push for <em>&ldquo;strict implementation&rdquo;</em> of the deal concerning Idlib because that province of Syria is where the terrorists emerged from.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The arrangements reached in 2019 and 2020 provided for our Turkish friends to control the situation in the Idlib de-escalation zone and to separate the HTS from the opposition, which is non-terrorist and which cooperates with T&uuml;rkiye,</em>&rdquo; Lavrov said.</p>
<p>Military and security leaders of all three countries are also in contact with each other, Russia&rsquo;s top diplomat added.</p>
<p>Carlson sought a meeting with Lavrov, saying he was appalled that the US and Russia are inching closer to an open war over Ukraine. He also tried to get an interview with Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky but this was blocked, reportedly by the US government.</p>

                            <p><strong>The “unprecedented” restrictions imposed on Russia have only made it stronger, the Foreign Minister has said</strong></p>


            <p>The sanctions imposed by the collective West in the wake of the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict &ndash; and before it &ndash; have only made the country <em>&ldquo;stronger&rdquo;</em> and more self-sufficient, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has told US journalist Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>Asked, during an interview published on Friday, whether the lifting of the sanctions would be among terms discussed in potential negotiations to end the Ukrainian conflict, Lavrov signaled that was apparently not the case. The top diplomat, however, did not explicitly reject such a prospect.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I would say probably many people in Russia would like to make it a condition. But the more we live under sanctions, the more we understand that it is better to rely on yourself, and to develop mechanisms, platforms for cooperation with &lsquo;normal&rsquo; countries who are not unfriendly to you, and don&rsquo;t mix economic interests and policies, and especially politics,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov explained.</p>
<p>The country has learned <em>&ldquo;a lot after the sanctions started,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov said, noting the West began imposing its restrictions long before February 2022.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;The sanctions started under President Obama. They continued in a very big way under the first term of Donald Trump. And these sanctions under the Biden administration are absolutely unprecedented,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the restrictions have only made Russia more resilient and self-sufficient, Lavrov explained. <em>&ldquo;But what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger, you know. They would never kill us, so they are making us stronger,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>The minister rejected the assertion that it was the sanctions that had ultimately driven Russia to the East, stating the turn was triggered by the attitude to the country of the West itself and its refusal to recognize the country&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It started after the demise of the Soviet Union. There was euphoria, we are now part of the &lsquo;liberal world&rsquo;, democratic world, &lsquo;end of history&rsquo;. But very soon it became clear to most Russians that in the 1990s we were treated as, at best, a junior partner, maybe not even as a partner, but as a place where the West can organize things like it wants, striking deals with oligarchs, buying resources and assets,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov recalled.</p>

                            <p><strong>Kiev and the West must abide by UN and OSCE principles, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said</strong></p>


            <p>Russia has been clear about the goals of its military operation and the terms on which it will end, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has told US journalist Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin is often falsely accused of refusing to negotiate with Ukraine, Lavrov told Carlson in the interview, which was published on Friday. Two years ago Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky actually outlawed any talks with Moscow, apparently based on a belief that he and the West would dictate terms of a truce, Russia&rsquo;s top diplomat pointed out.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;For starters, why don&rsquo;t you tell him [Zelensky] to cancel it [the order] publicly? This will be a signal that he wants negotiations,&rdquo; </em>Lavrov said.</p>
<p>Asked about the terms Russia would agree to, Lavrov pointed Carlson to Putin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/599300-putin-foreign-policy-recap/">June speech</a>, in which the Russian president laid out Moscow's position; Ukraine would have to withdraw its forces from Russian territory, ensure the rights of Russian-speaking residents and become a neutral, nuclear-free state.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The key principle is non-bloc status of Ukraine,&rdquo; </em>Lavrov told Carlson. <em>&ldquo;No NATO. Absolutely. No military bases, no military exercises on Ukrainian soil with participation of foreign troops.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Likewise, Moscow&nbsp;will not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/599516-russia-thorny-path-peace-ukraine/&nbsp;">tolerate any deal</a> under which Ukraine could continue discriminating against the Russian language, media, culture and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the top diplomat added.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are not playing a double game,</em>&rdquo; Lavrov said. <em>&ldquo;What President Putin announced is the goal of our operation. It&rsquo;s fair. It&rsquo;s fully in line with the UN Charter. First of all, the rights: language rights, minority rights, national minority rights, religious rights.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In February 2022, when the conflict escalated, Moscow pointed to Kiev&rsquo;s violation of the Minsk Agreements, repression of Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine and attacks on the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics. Since then, Ukraine has also outlawed the canonical Orthodox Church and sought to replace it with&nbsp;a 'cut-out'&nbsp;created by the government.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s objectives are also <em>&ldquo;fully in line&rdquo;</em> with the principles of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which the US is also a member of, Lavrov pointed out. The OSCE has repeatedly declared that no one should expand their security at the expense of others and that no organization in its sphere can claim dominance, Lavrov reminded Carlson.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;NATO was doing exactly the opposite. So, we have legitimacy in our position,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov said. <em>&ldquo;No NATO on our doorsteps because OSCE agreed that this should not be the case if it hurts us.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s top diplomat also pointed out that the West has been saying <em>&ldquo;nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> while breaking that pledge in back-channel communications, but also implicitly trying to craft Russia&rsquo;s fate without Russia &ndash; and that, he said, is something Moscow can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t accept.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The hypersonic missile was a message to Washington, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said</strong></p>


            <p>Moscow will use all means at its disposal to defend its national interests, and hopes Washington has understood this after the test launch of the Oreshnik hypersonic missile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has told US journalist Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>Carlson, who interviewed President Vladimir Putin earlier this year, returned to Russia to speak with Lavrov after unsuccessful attempts to sit down with Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to aggravate the situation, but since ATACMS and other long-range weapons are being used against mainland Russia as it were, we are sending signals,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov said. <em>&ldquo;We hope that the last one, a couple of weeks ago, the signal with the new weapon system called Oreshnik, was taken seriously.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia launched the hypersonic medium-range ballistic missile at a Ukrainian military-industrial facility in Dnepropetrovsk. Videos making rounds on social media showed bolts of light from the sky impacting deep underground, followed by secondary explosions. The site has been off-limits to the press ever since.</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p>Half an hour before the launch of the Oreshnik, Russia sent a message to the US using the nuclear deconfliction line, so <em>&ldquo;that they don't mistake it for anything bigger and real dangerous,&rdquo;</em> according to Lavrov. Carlson noted that Oreshnik <em>&ldquo;sounds very dangerous&rdquo;</em> on its own.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The message is that you, I mean the US and the allies of the US, who also provide these long-range weapons to the Kiev regime, they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call strategic defeat of Russia</em>,&rdquo; Lavrov told Carlson. Moscow is <em>&ldquo;ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interests,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/607969-us-nuclear-strike-exchange/">recent comments</a> of an American admiral about the theoretical acceptability of using atomic weapons, Lavrov said that this kind of rhetoric was <em>&ldquo;really worrying&rdquo;</em> and appears to assume that Russia does not have &lsquo;red lines&rsquo; or is not willing to enforce them.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;This is a very serious mistake,&rdquo;</em> the Russian diplomat said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the US and Russia are at war, Lavrov said that it&rsquo;s an undeclared, <em>&ldquo;hybrid war&rdquo;</em> at the moment and Moscow is letting Washington know that it should not escalate.</p>
<p>Since an actual war with the US <em>&ldquo;would take a nuclear character,&rdquo;</em> the veteran diplomat explained, <em>&ldquo;we would certainly like to avoid any misunderstanding. And since some people in Washington and some people in London, in Brussels, seem to be not very capable [of understanding], we will send additional messages if they don&rsquo;t draw necessary conclusions.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov joined the conservative American journalist to discuss recent international issues and to explain Russia’s position</strong></p>


            <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov&nbsp;has given&nbsp;an exclusive interview to conservative American journalist Tucker Carlson this week. The two talked about a wide range of topics of international concern, primarily the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as the state of US-Russia relations. Here&rsquo;s the full text of the conversation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Carlson:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minister Lavrov, thank you for doing this. Do you believe the United States and Russia are at war with each other right now?</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. And in any case, this is not what we want. We would like to have normal relations with all our neighbors, of course, but generally with all countries, especially with a great country like the United States. And President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly expressed his respect for the American people, for American history, for American achievements in the world, and we don&rsquo;t see any reason why Russia and the United States cannot cooperate for the sake of the universe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But the United States is funding a conflict that you&rsquo;re involved in, of course, and now is allowing attacks on Russia itself. So that doesn&rsquo;t constitute war?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, we officially are not at war. But what is going on in Ukraine is what some people call a hybrid war. I would call it a hybrid war as well, but it is obvious that the Ukrainians would not be able to do what they&rsquo;re doing with long-range modern weapons without the direct participation of American servicemen. And this is dangerous, no doubt about this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to aggravate the situation, but since ATACMS and other long-range weapons are being used against mainland Russia as it were, we are sending signals. We hope that the last one, a couple of weeks ago, the signal with the new weapon system called <a href="https://eng.new.mil.ru/news/0923044a-8882-4ae6-a699-265bc7a12916">Oreshnik</a>, was taken seriously.</p>

<p>However, we also know that some officials in the Pentagon and in other places, including NATO, started saying in the last few days something like that NATO is a defensive alliance, but sometimes you can strike first because the attack is the best defense. Some others in STRATCOM, Thomas Buchanan is his name, representative of STRATCOM, said something which allows for an eventuality of exchange of limited nuclear strikes.</p>
<p>And these kinds of threats are really worrying. Because if they are following the logic which some Westerners have been pronouncing lately, that don&rsquo;t believe that Russia has red lines, they announced their red lines, these red lines are being moved again and again. This is a very serious mistake. That&rsquo;s what I would like to say in response to this question.</p>
<p>It is not us who started the war. Putin repeatedly said that we started <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843">the special military operation</a> in order to end the war which the Kiev regime was conducting against its own people in parts of Donbass. And just in his <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/75614">latest statement</a>, President Putin clearly indicated that we are ready for any eventuality. But we strongly prefer a peaceful solution through negotiations on the basis of respecting the legitimate security interest of Russia, and on the basis of respecting the people who live in Ukraine, who still live in Ukraine, being Russians. Their basic human rights, language rights, religious rights, have been exterminated by a series of legislation passed by the Ukrainian parliament. They started long before <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843">the special military operation</a>. Since 2017, legislation was passed prohibiting Russian education in Russian, prohibiting Russian media operating in Ukraine, then prohibiting Ukrainian media working in the Russian language, and the latest, of course there were also steps to cancel any cultural events in Russian. Russian books were thrown out of libraries and exterminated. The latest was the law prohibiting the canonic Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s very interesting when people in the West say we want this conflict to be resolved on the basis of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text">the UN Charter</a> and respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and Russia must withdraw. The Secretary General of the United Nations says similar things. Recently his representative repeated that the conflict must be resolved on the basis of international law, the UN Charter and General Assembly resolutions, while respecting the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It&rsquo;s a misnomer, because if you want to respect the United Nations Charter, you have to respect it in its entirety. The United Nations Charter, among other things, says that all countries must respect the equality of states and the right of people to self-determination. And they also mentioned the United Nations General Assembly resolutions, and this is clear that what they mean is the series of resolutions which they passed after the beginning of this <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843">special military operation</a>&nbsp;which demand the condemnation of Russia, that Russia get out of Ukraine; territory in its 1991 borders. But there are other United Nations General Assembly resolutions which were not voted on, but which were consensual, and among them is a declaration on principles of relations between states on the basis of the Charter. And it clearly says, by consensus, everybody must respect the territorial integrity of states whose governments respect the right of people for self-determination, and because of that represent the entire population living on a given territory.</p>
<p>To argue that the people who came to power through military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in February 2014 represented Crimeans or the citizens of eastern and southern Ukraine is absolutely useless. It is obvious that Crimeans rejected the coup. They said, leave us alone, we don&rsquo;t want to have anything with you. So we did: Donbass and Crimeans held referendums, and they rejoined Russia. Donbass was declared by the putschists who came to power a &lsquo;terrorist group&rsquo;. They were shelled, attacked by artillery. The war started, which was stopped in February 2015.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/47664">The Minsk agreements</a> were signed. We were very sincerely interested in closing this drama by seeing the Minsk agreements implemented fully. It was sabotaged by the government which was established after the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in Ukraine. There was a demand that they enter into a direct dialogue with the people who did not accept the coup. There was a demand that they promote economic relations with that part of Ukraine. And so on and so forth. None of this was done.</p>

<p>The people in Kiev were saying we would never talk to them directly. And this is in spite of the fact that the demand to talk to them directly was endorsed by the [UN] Security Council. The putschists said they are terrorists, we would be fighting them, and they would be dying in cellars because we are stronger.</p>
<p>Had the coup in February 2014 not happened and the deal which was reached the day before between the then president and the opposition [been] implemented, Ukraine would have stayed in one piece by now, with Crimea in it. It&rsquo;s absolutely clear. They did not deliver on the deal. Instead they staged the coup. The deal, by the way, provided for the creation of a government of national unity in February 2014, and holding early elections, which the then president would have lost. Everybody knew that. But they were impatient and took the government buildings the next morning. They went to this Maidan Square and announced that they had created the government of the winners. Compare the government of national unity to prepare for elections and the government of the winners.</p>
<p>How can the people whom they, in their view, defeated, how can they pretend that they respect the authorities in Kiev? You know, the right to self-determination is the international legal basis for the decolonization process which took place in Africa on the basis of this charter principle, the right to self-determination. The people in the colonies, they never treated their colonial powers, colonial masters, as somebody who represents them, as somebody whom they want to see in the structures which govern those lands. By the same token, the people in the east and south of Ukraine, people in Donbass and Novorossiya, they don&rsquo;t consider the Zelensky regime as something which represents their interests. How can they do that when their culture, their language, their traditions, their religion, all this was prohibited?</p>
<p>The last point is that if we speak about <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text">the UN Charter</a>, resolutions, international law, the very first article of the UN Charter, which the West never, never recalls in the Ukrainian context, says, <em>&ldquo;Respect human rights of everybody, irrespective of race, gender, language, or religion.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Take any conflict. The United States, UK, Brussels, they would interfere, saying, <em>&ldquo;Oh, human rights have been grossly violated. We must restore the human rights in such and such territory.&rdquo;</em> On Ukraine, never, ever have they mumbled the words <em>&ldquo;human rights,&rdquo;</em> seeing these human rights for the Russian and Russian-speaking population being totally exterminated by law. So when people say, <em>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s resolve the conflict on the basis of the Charter,&rdquo;</em> - yes. But don&rsquo;t forget that the Charter is not only about territorial integrity. And territorial integrity must be respected only if the governments are legitimate and if they respect the rights of their own people.</p>
<p>Carlson:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to go back to what you said a moment ago about the introduction or the unveiling of the hypersonic weapons system that you said was a signal to the West. What signal exactly? I think many Americans are not even aware that this happened. What message were you sending by showing it to the world?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, the message is that you, I mean the United States, and the allies of the United States who also provide these long-range weapons to the Kiev regime, they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call the strategic defeat of Russia.</p>
<p>They fight for keeping the hegemony over the world on any country, any region, any continent. We fight for our legitimate security interests. They say, for example, 1991 borders. Lindsey Graham, who visited some time ago Vladimir Zelensky for another talk; he bluntly, in his presence, said that Ukraine is very rich with rare earth metals and they cannot leave this richness to the Russians. We must take it. We fight.</p>
<p>So they fight for a regime which is ready to sell or to give to the West all the natural and human resources. We fight for the people who have been living on these lands, whose ancestors were actually developing those lands, building cities, building factories for centuries and centuries. We care about people, not about natural resources which somebody in the United States would like to keep and to have Ukrainians just as servants sitting on these natural resources.</p>
<p>So, the message which we wanted to send by testing in real action this hypersonic system is that we will be ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interests.</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p>We hate even to think about war with the United States, which will take nuclear character. Our <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/75598">military doctrine</a> says that the most important thing is to avoid a nuclear war. And it was us, by the way, who initiated in January 2022 the message, <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67551">the joint statement</a> by the leaders of the five permanent members of the Security Council saying that we will do anything to avoid confrontation between us, acknowledging and respecting each other&rsquo;s security interests and concerns. This was our initiative.</p>
<p>And the security interests of Russia were totally ignored when they rejected at about the same time the proposal to conclude a treaty on security guarantees for Russia, for Ukraine in the context of coexistence and in a context where Ukraine would not ever be a member of NATO or any other military bloc. These security interests of Russia were presented to the West, to NATO and to the United States in <a href="https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1790809/?lang=en">December 2021</a>. We discussed them several times, including during my meeting with Antony Blinken in Geneva in <a href="https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1795493/?lang=en">January 2022</a>. And this was rejected.</p>
<p>So we would certainly like to avoid any misunderstanding. And since the people, some people in Washington and some people in London, in Brussels, seemed to be not very capable of understanding, we will send additional messages if they don&rsquo;t draw the necessary conclusions.</p>
<p>Carlson:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;re having a conversation about a potential nuclear exchange and it&rsquo;s real... thought I&rsquo;d never see.</p>
<p>And it raises the question, how much back-channel dialogue is there between Russia and the United States? Has there been for the last two and a half years? Is there any conversation ongoing?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>There are several channels, but mostly on the exchange of people who serve [prison] terms in Russia and in the United States. There were several swaps.</p>

<p>There are also channels which are not advertised or publicized, but basically the Americans send through these channels the same message which they send publicly. You have to stop, you have to accept the way which will be based on the Ukrainian needs and position. They support this absolutely pointless &lsquo;peace formula&rsquo; by Vladimir Zelensky, which was additioned recently by [his] &lsquo;victory plan&rsquo;. They held several series of meetings, Copenhagen format, Burgenstock. And they brag that [in the] first half of next year they will convene another conference and they will graciously invite Russia that time. And then Russia would be presented an ultimatum.</p>
<p>All this is seriously repeated through various confidential channels. Now we hear something different, including Vladimir Zelensky&rsquo;s statements that we can stop now at the line of engagement, line of contact. The Ukrainian government will be admitted to NATO, but NATO guarantees at this stage would cover only the territory controlled by the government, and the rest would be subject to negotiations. But the end result of these negotiations must be the total withdrawal of Russia from Ukrainian soil. Leaving Russian people to the Nazi regime, which exterminated all the rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking citizens of their own country.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>If I could just go back to the question of nuclear exchange. So there is no mechanism by which the leaders of Russia and the United States can speak to each other to avoid the kind of misunderstanding that could kill hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No. We have this channel which is automatically engaged when a ballistic missile launch is taking place.</p>
<p>As regards this Oreshnik hypersonic mid-range ballistic missile. 30 minutes in advance, the system sent the message to the United States. They knew that this was the case and that they don&rsquo;t mistake it for anything bigger and really dangerous.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>

<p>I think the system sounds very dangerous.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, it was a test launch, you know.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Yes. Oh, you&rsquo;re speaking of the test, okay. But I just wonder how worried you are that, considering there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a lot of conversation between the two countries. Both sides are speaking about exterminating the other&rsquo;s populations. That this could somehow get out of control in a very short period and no one could stop it. It seems incredibly reckless.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No, we are not talking about exterminating anybody&rsquo;s population. We did not start this war. We have been, for years and years and years, sending warnings that pushing NATO closer and closer to our borders is going to create a problem.</p>
<p>In 2007, Putin started to explain [this] to the people who seemed to be overtaken by the &lsquo;end of history&rsquo; and being dominant, no challenge, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And of course, when the coup took place, the Americans did not hide that they were behind it. There is a conversation between Victoria Nuland and the then-American ambassador in Kiev when they discuss personalities to be included in the new government after the coup. The figure of $5 billion spent on Ukraine after independence was mentioned as the guarantee that everything would be like the Americans want.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have any intention to exterminate Ukrainian people. They are brothers and sisters to the Russian people.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>How many have died so far, do you think, on both sides?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>It is not disclosed by the Ukrainians. Vladimir Zelensky was saying that it is much less than 80,000 persons on the Ukrainian side.</p>

<p>But there is one very reliable figure. In Palestine during one year after the Israelis started their operation in response to this terrorist attack, which we <a href="https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1907962/?lang=en">condemned</a>. And this operation, of course, acquired the proportion of collective punishment, which is against international humanitarian law as well. So during one year after the operation started in Palestine, the number of Palestinian civilians killed is estimated at 45,000. This is almost twice as many as the number of civilians on both sides of Ukrainian conflict who died during ten years after the coup. One year and ten years. So it is a tragedy in Ukraine. It&rsquo;s a disaster in Palestine, but we never, ever had as our goal killing people.</p>
<p>And the Ukrainian regime did. The head of the office of Vladimir Zelensky once said that we will make sure that cities like Kharkov, Nikolaev will forget what Russian means at all. Another guy in his office stated that Ukrainians must exterminate Russians through law or, if necessary, physically. Ukrainian former ambassador to Kazakhstan Pyotr Vrublevsky became famous when giving an interview and looking into the camera (being recorded and broadcast) he said: <em>&ldquo;Our main task is to kill as many Russians as we can so that our children have less things to do&rdquo;</em>. And statements like this are all over the vocabulary of the regime.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>How many Russians in Russia have been killed since February of 2022?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for me to disclose this information. In the time of military operations special rules exist. Our <a href="https://mil.ru/">ministry of defense</a> follows these rules.</p>
<p>But there is a very interesting fact that when Vladimir Zelensky was playing not in international arena, but at his comedy club or whatever it is called, he was (there are videos from that period) bluntly defending the Russian language. He was saying: <em>&ldquo;What is wrong with Russian language? I speak Russian. Russians are our neighbors. Russian is one of our languages&rdquo;</em>. And get lost, he said, to those who wanted to attack the Russian language and Russian culture. When Vladimir Zelensky became president, he changed very fast.</p>
<p>Before the military operation, in September 2021, he was interviewed, and at that time he was conducting war against Donbass in violation of <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/47664">the Minsk agreements</a>. And the interviewer asked him what he thought about the people on the other side of the line of contact. He answered very thoughtfully there are people and there are species. And if you, living in Ukraine, feel associated with the Russian culture, my advice to you, for the sake of your kids, for the sake of your grandkids, get out to Russia.</p>
<p>And if this guy wants to bring Russians and people of Russian culture back under his territorial integrity, I mean, it shows that he&rsquo;s not adequate.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>So, what are the terms under which Russia would cease hostilities? What are you asking for?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in February 2014, we were asking only for the deal between the president and the opposition to have government of national unity, to hold early elections, to be implemented. The deal was signed. And we were asking for the implementation of this deal. They were absolutely impatient and aggressive. And they were, of course, pushed, I have no slightest doubt, by the Americans, because if Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador agreed the composition of the government, why wait for five months to hold early elections?</p>

<p>The next time we were in favor of something was when <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/47664">the Minsk Agreements</a> were signed. I was there. The negotiations lasted for 17 hours (well, Crimea was lost by that time because of <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/20626">referendum</a>). And nobody, including my colleague John Kerry, meeting with us, nobody in the West was worried about the issue of Crimea. Everybody was concentrated on Donbass. And the Minsk Agreements provided for territorial integrity of Ukraine, minus Crimea (this was not even raised) and a special status for a very tiny part of Donbass, not for the entire Donbass, not for Novorossiya at all. Part of Donbass, under these Minsk Agreements, endorsed by the Security Council, should have the right to speak Russian language, to teach Russian language, to study in Russian, to have local law enforcement (like in the states of U.S.), to be consulted when judges and prosecutors are appointed by the central authority, and to have some facilitated economic connections with neighboring regions of Russia. That&rsquo;s it. Something which President Macron promised to give to Corsica and still is considering how to do this.</p>
<p>And when these agreements were sabotaged all along by Pyotr Poroshenko and then by Vladimir Zelensky. Both of them, by the way, came to presidency, running on the promise of peace. And both of them lied. So when these Minsk Agreements were sabotaged to the extent that we saw the attempts to take this tiny part of Donbass by force, and we, as President Putin explained, at that time, we suggested these security arrangements to NATO and the United States, which was rejected. And when the Plan B was launched by Ukraine and its sponsors, trying to take this part of Donbass by force, it was then that we launched <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843">the special military operation</a>.</p>
<p>Had they implemented the Minsk Agreements Ukraine would be one piece, minus Crimea. But even then, when Ukrainians, after we started the operation, suggested to negotiate, we agreed, there were several rounds in Belarus, and one later they moved to Istanbul. And in Istanbul, Ukrainian delegation put a paper on the table saying: <em>&ldquo;Those are the principles on which we are ready to agree.&rdquo;</em> And we accepted those principles.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>The Minsk Principles?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No. The Istanbul Principles. It was April 2022.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Which was: no NATO, but security guarantees to Ukraine, collectively provided with the participation of Russia. And these security guarantees would not cover Crimea or the east of Ukraine. It was their proposal. And it was initialed. And the head of the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, who is now the chair of the Vladimir Zelensky faction in the parliament, he recently (a few months ago) in an interview, confirmed that this was the case. And on the basis of these principles, we were ready to draft a treaty.</p>
<p>But then this gentleman who headed the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul said that Boris Johnson visited and told them to continue to fight. Then there was&hellip;</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But Boris Johnson, on behalf of&hellip;</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>He said no. But the guy who initialed the paper, he said it was Boris Johnson. Other people say it was President Putin who ruined the deal because of the massacre in <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1862066/#sel=69:1:RPz,76:50:3xv">Bucha</a>. But they never mentioned any more massacre in <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1808149/">Bucha</a>. I do. And we do.</p>

<p>In a sense, they are on the defensive. Several times in the United Nations Security Council, sitting at the table with Antonio Guterres, I (last year and this year) at the General Assembly, I raised the issue of Bucha and said, guys, it is strange that you are silent about <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1818228/#sel=50:1:PLr,53:39:rrl">Bucha</a> because you were very vocal when BBC team found itself on the street where the bodies were located. I inquired, can we get the names of the persons whose bodies were broadcast by BBC? Total silence. I addressed Antonio Guterres personally in the presence of the Security Council members. He did not respond. Then at my <a href="https://www.mid.ru/ru/press_service/video/vistupleniya_ministra/1905984/?lang=en">press conference</a> in New York after the end of the General Assembly last September, I asked all the correspondents: guys, you are journalists. Maybe you&rsquo;re not an investigative journalists but journalists normally are interested to get the truth. And <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1942147/">Bucha</a> thing, which was played all over the media outlets condemning Russia, is not of any interest to anyone - politicians, UN officials. And now even journalists. I asked when I talked to them in <a href="https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1972854/?lang=en">September</a>, please, as professional people, try to get the names of those whose bodies were shown in Bucha. No answer.</p>
<p>Just like we don&rsquo;t have any answer to the question, where is the results of medical analysis of Alexey Navalny, who died recently, but who was treated in Germany in the fall of 2020. When he felt bad on a plane over Russia, the plane landed. He was treated by the Russian doctors in Siberia. Then the Germans wanted to take him. We immediately allowed the plane to come. They took him. In less than 24 hours, he was in Germany. And then the Germans continued to say that we poisoned him. And now the analysis confirmed that he was poisoned. We <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1441572/">asked</a> for the test results to be given to us. They said, no, we give it to the organization on chemical weapons. We <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1442306/">went</a> to this organization, we are members, and we <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1450110/">said</a>, can you show to us, because this is our citizen, we are accused of having poisoned him. They said that the Germans told us not to give it to you. They found nothing in the civilian hospital, and the announcement that he was poisoned was made after he was treated in the military Bundeswehr hospital. So it seems that this secret is not going&hellip;</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>So how did Navalny die?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, he died serving the term in Russia. As far as it was reported, every now and then he felt not well. Which was another reason why we continued to <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1443110/">ask</a> the Germans: can you <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1770047/">show us</a> the results which you found? Because we did not find what they found. And what they did to him, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>What the Germans did to him?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Yeah, because they don&rsquo;t explain to anybody, including us. Or maybe they explain to the Americans. Maybe this is credible.</p>
<p>But they never told us how they treated him, what they found, and what methods they were using.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>How do you think he died?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I am not a doctor. But for anybody to guess, even for the doctors to try to guess, they need to have information. And if the person was taken to Germany to be treated after he had been poisoned, the results of the tests cannot be secret.</p>
<p>We still cannot get anything credible on the fate of <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1568473/#sel=103:1:W2V,193:28:22X">Skripals</a> - Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1574067/">information</a> is not provided to us. He is our citizen, she is our citizen. We have all the rights and the conventions which the UK is party to, to get information.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Why do you think that Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister of the UK, would have stopped the peace process in Istanbul? On whose behalf was he doing that?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, I met with him a couple of times, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he was motivated by some immediate desire or by some long-term strategy. He is not very predictable.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But do you think he was acting on behalf of the US government, on behalf of the Biden administration, or he was doing this independently.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. And I wouldn&rsquo;t guess. The fact that the Americans and the Brits are leading in this <em>&ldquo;situation&rdquo;</em> is obvious.</p>
<p>Now it is becoming also clear that there is a fatigue in some capitals, and there are talks every now and then that the Americans would like to leave it with the Europeans and to concentrate on something more important. I wouldn&rsquo;t guess.</p>

<p>We would be judging by specific steps. It&rsquo;s obvious, though, that the Biden administration would like to leave a legacy to the Trump administration as bad as they can.</p>
<p>And similar to what Barack Obama did to Donald Trump during his first term. Then late December 2016, President Obama expelled Russian diplomats. Just very late December. 120 persons with family members. Did it on purpose. Demanded them leave on the day when there was no direct flight from Washington to Moscow. So they had to move to New York by buses with all their luggage, with children, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And at the same time, President Obama announced the arrest of pieces of <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1540536/#sel=113:1:Umv,123:117:VX3">diplomatic property</a> of Russia. And we still never were able to come and see what is the state of this Russian property.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>What was the property?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Diplomatic. They never allowed us to come and see it though under all conventions. They just say that these pieces we don&rsquo;t consider as being covered by diplomatic immunity, which is a unilateral decision, never substantiated by any international court.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>So you believe the Biden administration is doing something similar again to the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Because that episode with the expulsion and the seizure of property certainly did not create the promising ground for beginning of our relations with the Trump administration. So I think they&rsquo;re doing the same.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But this time President Trump was elected on the explicit promise to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. So I mean, he said that in appearance after appearance. So given that, there is hope for a resolution, it sounds like. What are the terms to which you&rsquo;d agree?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, the terms, I basically alluded to them. When President Putin spoke in this Ministry of Foreign Affairs on <a href="https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1957107/?lang=en">the 14th of June</a> he once again reiterated that we were ready to negotiate on the basis of the principles which were agreed in Istanbul and rejected by Boris Johnson, according to the statement of the head of the Ukrainian delegation.</p>
<p>The key principle is non-bloc status of Ukraine. And we would be ready to be part of the group of countries who would provide collective security guarantees to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But no NATO?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No NATO. Absolutely. No military bases, no military exercises on the Ukrainian soil with participation of foreign troops. And this is something which he reiterated. But of course, he said, it was April 2022, now some time has passed, and the realities on the ground would have to be taken into account and accepted.</p>

<p>The realities on the ground are not only the line of contact, but also the changes in <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm">the Russian Constitution</a> after referendum was held in Donetsk, Lugansk republics and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. And they are now part of the Russian Federation, according to the Constitution. And this is a reality.</p>
<p>And of course, we cannot tolerate a deal which would keep the legislation which are prohibiting Russian language, Russian media, Russian culture, Ukrainian Orthodox Church, because it is a violation of the obligations of Ukraine under <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text">the UN Charter</a>, and something must be done about it. And the fact that the West (since this russophobic legislative offensive started in 2017) was totally silent and it is silent until now, of course we would have to pay attention to this in a very special way.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Would sanctions against Russia be a condition?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>You know, I would say probably many people in Russia would like to make it a condition. But the more we live under sanctions, the more we understand that it is better to rely on yourself, and to develop mechanisms, platforms for cooperation with &lsquo;normal&rsquo; countries who are not unfriendly to you, and don&rsquo;t mix economic interests and policies and especially politics. And we learned a lot after the sanctions started.</p>
<p>The sanctions started under President Obama. They continued in a very big way under the first term of Donald Trump. And these sanctions under the Biden administration are absolutely unprecedented.</p>
<p>But what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger, you know. They would never kill us, so they are making us stronger.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>And driving Russia east. And so the vision that I think same policymakers in Washington had 20 years ago is why not to bring Russia into a Western bloc, sort of as a balance against the rising east. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that. Do you think that&rsquo;s still possible?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. When recently President Putin was speaking at <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/75521">Valdai Club</a> to politologists and experts, he said we would never be back at the situation of early 2022. That&rsquo;s when he realized (for himself, apparently, not only he, but he spoke publicly about this) that all attempts to be on equal terms with the West have failed.</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p>It started after the demise of the Soviet Union. There was euphoria, we are now part of the &lsquo;liberal world&rsquo;, democratic world, &lsquo;end of history&rsquo;. But very soon it became clear to most of the Russians that in the 1990s we were treated as - at best as junior partner, maybe not even as a partner, - but as a place where the West can organize things like it wants, striking deals with oligarchs, buying resources and assets. And then probably the Americans decided that Russia is in their pocket. Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, buddies, laughing, joking.</p>
<p>But even at the end of Boris Yeltsin&rsquo;s term, he started to contemplate that this was not something he wanted for Russia. And I think this was very obvious when he appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister, and then left earlier, and blessed Vladimir Putin as his successor for the elections which were coming and which Putin won.</p>
<p>But when Vladimir Putin became president, he was very much open to cooperation with the West. And he mentions about this quite regularly when he speaks with interviewers or at some international events.</p>
<p>I was present when he met with George Bush Jr., with Barack Obama. Well, after the meeting of NATO in Bucharest, which was followed by <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/44084">NATO-Russia summit meeting</a> in 2008, when they announced that Georgia and Ukraine will be in NATO. And then they tried to sell it to us. We asked: why? There was lunch and President Putin asked what was the reason for this? Good question. And they said this is something which is not obligatory. How come?</p>
<p>Well, to start the process of joining NATO, you need a formal invitation. And this is a slogan - Ukraine and Georgia will be in NATO. But this slogan became obsession for some people in Tbilisi first, when Mikhail Saakashvili lost his senses and started the war against his own people under the protection of OSCE mission with the Russian peacekeepers on the ground. And the fact that he launched this was confirmed by the European Union investigation, which they launched and which concluded that he gave the order to start.</p>
<p>And for Ukrainians, it took a bit longer. They were cultivating this pro-Western mood. Well, pro-Western is not bad, basically. Pro-Eastern is also not bad. What is bad is that you tell people, either/or, either you go with me or you&rsquo;re my enemy.</p>
<p>What happened before the coup in Ukraine? In 2013, the president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych negotiated with the European Union some association agreement which would nullify tariffs on most of the Ukrainian goods to the European Union and the other way around. And at some point, when he was meeting with Russian counterparts, we told him, Ukraine was part of the free trade area of the Commonwealth of Independent States. No tariffs for everybody. And we, Russia, negotiated agreement with World Trade Organization for some 17 years, mostly because we bargained with European Union. And we achieved some protection for many of our sectors, agriculture and some others. We explained to the Ukrainians that if you go zero in your trade with European Union, we would have to protect our customs border with Ukraine. Otherwise the zero tariff European goods would flood and would be hurting our industries, which we tried to protect and agreed for some protection. And we suggested to the European Union: guys, Ukraine is our common neighbor. You want to have better trade with Ukraine. We want the same. Ukraine want to have markets both in Europe and in Russia. Why don&rsquo;t we sit three of us and discuss it like grownups? The head of the European Commission was the Portuguese Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso. He responded it&rsquo;s none of your business what we do with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then the president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych convened his experts. And they said, yes, it would be not very good if we have opened the border with European Union, but the customs border with Russia would be closed. And they would be checking, you know, what is coming. So that the Russian market is not affected.</p>
<p>So he announced in November 2013 that he cannot sign the deal immediately, and he asked the European Union to postpone it for until next year. That was the trigger for Maidan, which was immediately thrown up and ended by the coup.</p>
<p>So my point is that this either/or. Actually, the first coup took place in 2004, when after second round of elections, the same Viktor Yanukovych won presidency. The West raised hell and put pressure on the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to rule that there must be a third round. The Constitution of Ukraine says there may be only two rounds. But the Constitutional Court, under the pressure of the West, violated the Constitution for the first time then. And pro-Western candidate was chosen. At that time, when all this was taking place and boiling, the European leaders were publicly saying Ukrainian people must decide: are they with us or with Russia?</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But it is the way that big countries behave. I mean, there are certain orbits, and now it&rsquo;s BRICS versus NATO, US versus China. And it sounds like you&rsquo;re saying the Russian-Chinese alliance is permanent.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, we are neighbors. And of course geography is very important.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also neighbors with Western Europe. And you&rsquo;re part of it, in effect.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Through Ukraine the Western Europe wants to come to our borders.</p>
<p>And there were plans that were discussed almost openly to put British naval bases on the Sea of Azov. Crimea was eyed. Dreaming about creating NATO base in Crimea and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Look, we have been very friendly with Finland, for example. Overnight, the Finns came back to the early years of preparation for World War II when they were best allies of Hitler. And all this neutrality, all this friendship, going to sauna together, playing hockey together, all this disappeared overnight. So maybe this was deep in their hearts, and the neutrality was burdening them, and niceties were burdening for them. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mad about the &lsquo;winter war&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s totally possible.</p>
<p>Can you negotiate with Zelensky? You&rsquo;ve pointed out that he has exceeded his term. He&rsquo;s not democratically elected president of Ukraine anymore. So do you consider him a suitable partner for negotiations?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>President Putin addressed many times this issue as well. In September 2022, during the first year of <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843">the special military operation</a>, Vladimir Zelensky, in his conviction that he would be dictating the terms of the situation also to the West, he signed a decree prohibiting any negotiations with Putin&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>During public events after that episode, President Vladimir Putin is asked why Russia is not ready for negotiations. He said, don&rsquo;t turn it upside down. We are ready for negotiations, provided it will be based on the balance of interest, tomorrow. But Vladimir Zelensky signed this decree prohibiting negotiations. For starters, why don&rsquo;t you tell him to cancel it publicly? This will be a signal that he wants negotiations. Instead, Vladimir Zelensky invented his &lsquo;peace formula&rsquo;. Lately, it was complemented by a &lsquo;victory plan&rsquo;. They keep saying, we know what they say when they meet with European Union ambassadors and in other formats, they say no deal unless the deal is on our terms.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you that they are planning now the second summit on the basis of this peace formula, and they don&rsquo;t shy away from saying, we will invite Russia to put in front of it the deal which we agreed already with the West.</p>
<p>When our Western colleagues sometimes say nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine in effect, this implies that anything about Russia without Russia. Because they discuss what kind of conditions we must accept.</p>
<p>By the way, recently they already violated, tacitly, the concept nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. There are passes, there are messages. They know our position. We are not playing double game. What President Putin announced is the goal of our operation. It&rsquo;s fair. It&rsquo;s fully in line with <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text">the United Nations Charter</a>. First of all, the rights: language rights, minority rights, national minority rights, religious rights, and it&rsquo;s fully in line with OSCE principles.</p>
<p>There is an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which is still alive. And well, several summits of this organization clearly stated that security must be indivisible, that nobody should expand his security at the expense of security of others, and that, most important, no organization in Euro-Atlantic space shall claim dominance. This was last time it was confirmed by OSCE in 2010.</p>
<p>NATO was doing exactly the opposite. So we have legitimacy in our position. No NATO on our doorsteps because OSCE agreed that this should not be the case if it hurts us. And please restore the rights of Russians.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Who do you think has been making foreign policy decisions in the United States? This is a question in the United States. Who is making these decisions?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t guess. I haven&rsquo;t seen Antony Blinken for years. When it was the last time? Two years ago, I think, at the G20 summit. Was it in Rome or somewhere? In the margins. I was representing President Putin there. His assistant came up to me during a meeting and said that Antony wants to talk just for ten minutes. I left the room. We shook hands, and he said something about the need to de-escalate and so on and so forth. I hope he&rsquo;s not going to be angry with me since I am disclosing this. But we were meeting in front of many people present in the room, and I said, <em>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to escalate. You want to inflict strategic defeat upon Russia.&rdquo;</em> He said, <em>&ldquo;No. It is not strategic defeat globally. It is only in Ukraine.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve not spoken to him since?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Have you spoken to any officials in the Biden administration since then?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to ruin their career.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But have you had meaningful conversations?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>When I met in international events one or another person whom I know, an American, some of them say hello, some of them exchange a few words, but I never impose myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming contagious when somebody sees an American talking to me or a European talking to me. Europeans are running away when they see me. During the last G20 meeting, it was ridiculous. Grown-up people, mature people. They behave like kids. So childish. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>So, you said that when in 2016, in December, the final moments of the Biden administration, Biden made the relationship between the United States and Russia more difficult.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Obama. Biden was vice-president.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>Exactly. I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>The Obama administration left a bunch of bombs, basically, for the incoming Trump administration.</p>
<p>In the last month since the election, you have all sorts of things going on politically in bordering states in this region. In Georgia, in Belarus, in Romania, and then, of course, most dramatically in Syria, you have turmoil.</p>
<p>Does this seem like part of an effort by the United States to make the resolution more difficult?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>There is nothing new, frankly. Because the US, historically, in foreign policy, was motivated by making some trouble and then to see if they can fish in the muddy water.</p>

<p>Iraqi aggression, Libyan adventure - ruining the state, basically. Fleeing from Afghanistan. Now trying to get back through the back door, using the United Nations to organize some &lsquo;event&rsquo; where the US can be present, in spite of the fact that they left Afghanistan in very bad shape and arrested money and don&rsquo;t want to give it back.</p>
<p>I think this is, if you analyze the American foreign policy steps, adventures, most of them are the right word - the pattern. They create some trouble, and then they see how to use it.</p>
<p>When the OSCE monitors elections, when it used to monitor elections in Russia, they would always be very negative, and in other countries as well, Belarus, Kazakhstan. This time, in Georgia, the monitoring mission of OSCE presented a positive report. And it is being ignored.</p>
<p>So when you need endorsement of the procedures, you do it when you like the results of the election. If you don&rsquo;t like the results of elections, you ignore it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when the United States and other Western countries recognized unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo, they said this is the self-determination being implemented. There was no referendum in Kosovo - unilateral declaration of independence. By the way, after that the Serbs approached International Court of Justice, which ruled that (well, normally they are not very specific in their judgment, but they ruled) that when part of a territory declares independence, it is not necessarily to be agreed with the central authorities.</p>
<p>And when a few years later, Crimeans were holding referendum with invitation of many international observers, not from international organizations, but from parliamentarians in Europe, in Asia, in post-Soviet space, they said, no, we cannot accept this because this is violation of territorial integrity.</p>
<p>You know, you pick and choose. <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text">The UN Charter</a> is not a menu. You have to respect it in all its entirety.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s paying the rebels who&rsquo;ve taken parts of Aleppo? Is the Assad government in danger of falling? What is happening exactly, in your view, in Syria?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, we had a deal when this crisis started. We organized the Astana process (Russia, T&uuml;rkiye and Iran). We meet <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1981205/">regularly</a>. Another meeting is being planned before the end of the year or early next year, to discuss the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are to help Syrians to come to terms with each other and to prevent separatist threats from getting strong. That&rsquo;s what the Americans are doing in the east of Syria when they groom some Kurdish separatists using the profits from oil and grain sold, the resources which they occupy.</p>
<p>This Astana format is a useful combination of players, if you wish. We are very much concerned. And when this happened, with Aleppo and surroundings, I had a conversation with the Turkish minister of foreign affairs and with Iranian colleague. We agreed to try to meet this week. Hopefully in Doha at the margins of this international conference. We would like to discuss the need to come back to strict implementation of the deals on Idlib area, because Idlib de-escalation zone was the place from where the terrorists moved to take Aleppo. The arrangements reached in 2019 and 2020 provided for our Turkish friends to control the situation in the Idlib de-escalation zone and to separate the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (former Nusra) from the opposition, which is non-terrorist and which cooperates with T&uuml;rkiye.</p>

<p>And another deal was the opening of M5 route from Damascus to Aleppo, which is also now taken completely by the terrorists. So we, as ministers of foreign affairs, would discuss the situation, hopefully, this coming Friday. And the military of all three countries and the security people are in contact with each other.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>But the Islamist groups, the terrorists you just described, who is backing them?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, we have some information. We would like to discuss with all our partners in this process the way to cut the channels of financing and arming them.</p>
<p>The information which is being floated and it&rsquo;s in the public domain mentions among others the Americans, the Brits. Some people say that Israel is interested in making this situation aggravated. So that Gaza is not under very close scrutiny. It&rsquo;s a complicated game. Many actors are involved. I hope that the context which we are planning for this week will help stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>What do you think of Donald Trump?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>I met him several times when he was having meetings with President Putin and when he received me twice in the Oval Office when I was visiting for bilateral talks.</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;s a very strong person. A person who wants results. Who doesn&rsquo;t like procrastination on anything. This is my impression. He&rsquo;s very friendly in discussions. But this does not mean that he&rsquo;s pro-Russian as some people try to present him. The amount of sanctions we received under the Trump administration was very big.</p>
<p>We respect any choice which is made by the people when they vote. We respect the choice of American people. As President Putin said, we are and we have been open all along to the contacts with the current administration. We hope that when Donald Trump is inaugurated, we will understand. The ball, as President Putin said, is on their side. We never severed our contacts, our ties in the economy, trade, security, anything.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>My final question is: how sincerely worried are you about an escalation in conflict between Russia and the United States, knowing what you do?</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Well, we started with this question, more or less.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>It seems the central question.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>Yes. The Europeans whisper to each other that it is not for Vladimir Zelensky to dictate the terms of the deal - it&rsquo;s for the US and Russia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should be presenting our relations as two guys decide for everybody. Not at all. It is not our style.</p>
<p>We prefer the manners which dominate in <a href="https://infobrics.org/">BRICS</a>, in <a href="https://eng.sectsco.org/">Shanghai Cooperation Organization</a>, where the UN Charter principle of sovereign equality of states is really embodied.</p>
<p>The US is not used to respect sovereign equality of states. When the US says we cannot allow Russia to win on Ukraine because this would undermine our rules-based world order. And rules-based world order is American domination.</p>

<p>Now, by the way, NATO, at least under Biden administration, is eyeing the entire Eurasian continent, Indo-Pacific strategies, South China Sea, East China Sea, is already on NATO agenda. NATO is moving infrastructure there. AUKUS, building &lsquo;quartet&rsquo; Indo-Pacific Four as they call it (Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea). US, South Korea, and Japan are building military alliance with some nuclear components. And Jens Stoltenberg, the former Secretary General of NATO, last year after the summit he said that the Atlantic security is indivisible from Indo-Pacific security. When he was asked does it mean that you go beyond territorial defense, he answered - no, it doesn&rsquo;t go beyond territorial defense, but to defend our territory, we need to be present there. This element of preemption is more and more present.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want war with anybody. And as I said, five nuclear states <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67551">declared</a> at the top level in January 2022 that we don&rsquo;t want confrontation with each other and that we shall respect each other&rsquo;s security interests and concerns. And it also stated nuclear war can never be won, and therefore nuclear war is not possible.</p>
<p>And the same was reiterated bilaterally between Russia and the United States, Putin-Biden, when they met in 2021 in Geneva in <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/65869">June</a>. Basically, they reproduced the statement by Reagan-Gorbachev of 1987 &lsquo;no nuclear war&rsquo;. And this is absolutely in our vital interest, and we hope that this is also in vital interest of the United States.</p>
<p>I say so because some time ago John Kirby, who is the White House communications coordinator, was answering questions about escalation and about possibility of nuclear weapons being employed. And he said, <em>&ldquo;Oh, no, we don&rsquo;t want escalation because then if there is some nuclear element, then our European allies would suffer.&rdquo;</em> So even mentally, he excludes that the United States can suffer. And this is something which makes the situation a bit risky. It might &ndash; if this mentality prevails, then some reckless steps would be taken, and this is bad.</p>
<p>Carlson:</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying is American policy makers imagine there could be a nuclear exchange that doesn&rsquo;t directly affect the United States, and you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Lavrov:</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I said, yes. But professionals in deterrence, nuclear deterrence policy, they know very well that it&rsquo;s a very dangerous game. And to speak about limited exchange of nuclear strikes is an invitation to disaster, which we don&rsquo;t want to have. &nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>At least 70,000 soldiers have been killed, Ukrainian journalist Yury Butusov has claimed, citing confidential general-staff data</strong></p>


            <p>The Ukrainian military has had at least 70,000 soldiers confirmed dead and another 35,000 missing in the conflict with Russia, journalist Yury Butusov, widely believed to be associated with former President Pyotr Poroshenko, has claimed, citing confidential data provided by the country&rsquo;s general staff to Vladimir Zelensky.</p>
<p>Butusov, editor-in-chief of the popular news website Censor.net, made the revelation on Thursday while responding to a question on whether rumored figures of 100,000 killed in action and 200,000 deserters held any merit.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Unfortunately, our irrecoverable losses in the war, they really amount to, according to the data that the General Staff transmitted to the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, if you count the dead and missing together, they amount to about 105,000 servicemen,&rdquo;</em> he stated.</p>
<p>Some 70,000 soldiers have been confirmed dead, with another 35,000 considered missing in action, Butusov noted. The journalist did not comment on the massive figure believed to reflect the number of soldiers who had gone AWOL.</p>

<p>The journalist also referred to a recent <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/608307-ukraine-losses-estimates-economist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> by The Economist, which cited leaked intelligence memos on the Ukrainian casualties. The weekly suggested Kiev has lost almost 500,000 troops, with <em>&ldquo;at least&rdquo;</em> 60,000-to-100,000 believed to be dead and <em>&ldquo;perhaps a further 400,000 too injured to fight on.&rdquo;</em> Butusov alleged the Western reporters likely got their figures from the same document he did.</p>
<p>The Economist report invoked a reaction from Zelensky himself, with the Ukrainian leader disputing the figure.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Someone recently gave information in the American media that 80,000 Ukrainians have been killed. But I want to tell you that no, less. Much less,&rdquo;</em> he told Kyodo News earlier this week.</p>
<p>Kiev has been extremely secretive about the casualties its military has sustained over the course of the conflict. The only time when an official figure was provided was in February this year, when Zelensky claimed some 31,000 troops had been killed since the beginning of the hostilities and dismissed any higher tallies as Russian propaganda. Earlier this year, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine&rsquo;s military losses, both killed and injured, since February 2022 had reached almost 500,000.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Resistance to increased mobilization calls is part of a political ploy, the outlet Strana has said</strong></p>


            <p>Kiev&rsquo;s public opposition to Western calls that it draft 18-year-olds for military service is part of a strategy for winning an election if the conflict with Moscow ends next spring, the Ukrainian outlet Strana has claimed.</p>
<p>Washington and its allies have publicly demanded the expansion of the draft to mobilize the 18-to-25 demographic, most recently on Wednesday, when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the argument in Brussels.</p>
<p>According to sources in the Ukrainian presidency, however, Kiev has opposed this as part of <em>&ldquo;a strategy to prepare for the scenario of a quick end to the war and the election afterward,&rdquo;</em> Strana reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>One possibility considered by Vladimir Zelensky is a negotiated end to the hostilities shortly after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump on January 20, the outlet said. The other option is that the talks will fail and the fighting will go on <em>&ldquo;for a long time.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Public statements about lowering the mobilization age <em>&ldquo;are being made in case the war ends soon and there are elections, so that they can talk about how they saved the gene pool of the nation,&rdquo;</em> Strana&rsquo;s source in Kiev said.</p>

<p>In case the talks fail and the fighting continues, the mobilization will have to be expanded sooner or later, <em>&ldquo;and Bankovaya will go for it, finding hundreds of reasons to explain the change in position,&rdquo;</em> the outlet&rsquo;s source added, referring to the address of the Ukrainian president&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/608710-us-ukraine-conscription-age-push/">Blinken argued</a> that Kiev had <em>&ldquo;hard decisions&rdquo;</em> to make about further mobilization. Even if Ukraine got all the money and the ammunition it wanted from the West, Blinken said at a NATO press conference, <em>&ldquo;there have to be people on the front lines,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Getting younger people into the fight, we think, many of us think, is necessary,&rdquo;</em> the US diplomat told Reuters. <em>&ldquo;Right now, 18- to 25-year-olds are not in the fight.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry has estimated Ukraine&rsquo;s losses at more than 500,000 since February 2022, though Zelensky has publicly admitted to less than a tenth of that. Kiev has sought to mobilize another 160,000 fighters in the coming months, to replenish depleted frontline units, as Russian forces gain ground.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>NATO knows it has lost its proxy war, but many of its members will still try to prevent a genuine peace</strong></p>


            <p>Russia&rsquo;s military operation in Ukraine has shattered many preconceptions about modern warfare. The &lsquo;drone revolution&rsquo; has garnered significant attention, but there is something far more critical at play. The conflict represents a direct, though proxy, clash between two nuclear superpowers in a region of vital importance to one of them.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, these sort of wars were fought on the periphery of great power confrontations, with significantly lower stakes. Today, in Ukraine, much like six decades ago during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world teeters once more on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<h2>The failure of strategic deterrence<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The Ukrainian crisis exposed a troubling reality for Russia: its concept of strategic deterrence proved incapable of preventing enemy aggression. While it has successfully deterred a massive nuclear attack by the United States or large-scale conventional aggression by NATO, it has failed to address a new and insidious form of conflict. Washington and its allies have gambled on inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia through a client state&mdash;one they control, arm, and direct.</p>
<p>Moscow&rsquo;s nuclear doctrine, designed for a very different set of circumstances, proved inadequate. It failed to prevent Western intervention at the outset and allowed its escalation. In response, the Kremlin has recognized the need to adapt. In the third year of the operation, a long-overdue update to the doctrine has been announced. This summer, President Vladimir Putin outlined the necessary changes. By November, the new document&mdash;entitled <em>Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence</em>&mdash;was in place.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s new in the doctrine?<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The updated doctrine represents a profound shift in Russia&rsquo;s nuclear policy, transforming it into a proactive deterrent. Previously, nuclear weapons could only be used in conventional conflicts when the very existence of the state was at risk. The threshold was set so high that it effectively allowed adversaries to exploit it. Now, the conditions have been broadened significantly.</p>
<p>One key addition is the recognition of <em>&ldquo;joint aggression.&rdquo;</em> If a non-nuclear state at war with Russia operates with the direct support of a nuclear power, Moscow reserves the right to respond, including with nuclear weapons. This sends a clear and unmistakable message to the United States, Britain, and France: their facilities and territories are no longer immune to retaliation.</p>
<p>The doctrine also explicitly accounts for scenarios involving massive aerospace attacks, including drones and cruise missiles, as well as aggression against Belarus. Another important change is the expanded list of threats deemed unacceptable to Russia&rsquo;s security. These changes collectively signal a more assertive posture, reflecting the reality of today&rsquo;s conflict and deterring potential Western miscalculations.</p>
<h2>The West&rsquo;s response<strong></strong></h2>
<p>Western reactions to these updates were predictable. Media hysteria painted Putin as reckless, while politicians feigned calm, claiming they would <em>&ldquo;not be intimidated.&rdquo;</em> The military and intelligence communities have remained largely silent, quietly drawing their own conclusions.</p>
<p>These updates come against an increasingly grim backdrop for the West. Realists within NATO understand the war in Ukraine is effectively lost. The Russian army holds the initiative across the front and is advancing steadily in the Donbass. The Ukrainian armed forces are unlikely to turn the tide in the foreseeable future, if ever. Consequently, Western strategists are now eyeing a ceasefire along the battle lines as the only viable option.</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p>Notably, there has been a subtle shift in the narrative. Articles in Reuters and other Western outlets suggest that Moscow, too, may consider freezing the conflict. However, such a scenario would need to align with Russian interests. For Moscow, anything less than full victory equates to defeat, and such an outcome is simply not an option.<br /> <br /> The administration of US President Joe Biden, despite the Democrats crushing election defeat, has apparently decided to &lsquo;help&rsquo; Donald Trump stay on course. The authorization to use US and British long-range missiles to hit targets in the Kursk and Bryansk regions is both a defiant challenge to Putin, and a &lsquo;gift&rsquo; to the president-elect. Likewise the transfer to Kiev of anti-personnel mines banned by the Ottawa Convention, a new batch of anti-Russian sanctions (including against Gazprombank) and an attempt to &lsquo;push&rsquo; the latest Biden aid package for Zelensky through Congress.</p>
<h2>The role of &lsquo;Oreshnik&rsquo;<strong></strong></h2>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s response to the escalation has not been limited to updating its doctrine. The recent test of the &lsquo;Oreshnik&rsquo; intermediate-range hypersonic missile under combat conditions marked a pivotal moment. By striking the Yuzhmash missile factory in Dnepropetrovsk, Moscow signaled to NATO that the vast majority of its European capitals are within range of this new weapon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oreshnik&rsquo; carries both conventional and nuclear warheads, and its speed &mdash; reportedly reaching up to Mach 10 &mdash; renders existing missile defense systems ineffective. Although still experimental, its successful deployment paves the way for mass production. The message is clear: Moscow is not bluffing.</p>
<p>This shift from verbal warnings to decisive actions underscores the seriousness of the Kremlin&rsquo;s resolve. The West has long convinced itself that Putin would never strike NATO countries. With the advent of &lsquo;Oreshnik,&rsquo; that belief has been shattered.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Escalation and the West&rsquo;s gamble<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The United States and its allies continue to escalate recklessly, betting on provoking a Russian overreaction. The authorization of long-range missile strikes on Russian territories like Kursk and Bryansk, combined with the transfer of banned weapons and the constant drumbeat of sanctions, reflects their desperation. More dangerously, there are whispers of Ukraine&rsquo;s potential NATO membership or even the transfer of nuclear weapons to Kiev. While the latter remains unlikely, the risk of a <em>&ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo;</em> cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>The West&rsquo;s hope, however, is that Russia might strike first with atomic weapons, handing NATO the moral high ground. Such an outcome would allow Washington to isolate Moscow globally, undermining its relationships with key players like China, India, and Brazil. Yet Moscow has countered these provocations with calculated precision, refusing to take the bait.</p>
<h2>What lies ahead<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The deployment of &lsquo;Oreshnik&rsquo; and the updated nuclear doctrine reaffirm Moscow&rsquo;s commitment to achieving peace on its terms. There will be no return to pre-2022 realities or a new Minsk Agreement. Rather, it is about securing Russia&rsquo;s long-term security and reshaping the geopolitical order in its favor.</p>
<p>As the conflict continues, much depends on the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election. Donald Trump&rsquo;s potential return to power offers an opportunity for dialogue, though the Kremlin remains skeptical. Regardless of who occupies the White House, Russia will not compromise its objectives.</p>
<p>The stakes are immense. For the West, a Russian victory threatens the United States&rsquo; global hegemony, the cohesion of NATO, and the future of the European Union. For Russia, anything less than full victory is unacceptable. As Putin recently stated, <em>&ldquo;Russia fights for peace, but it will not settle for a disadvantageous one.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In this high-stakes confrontation, it is Russia&rsquo;s actions, not its words, that will shape the future. The army continues to fight&mdash;not for the Ukraine of yesterday, but for the peace of tomorrow.</p>

                            <p><strong>The French president said he will appoint a new prime minister soon, after historic no-confidence vote ousted the prime minister</strong></p>


            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Thursday he will remain in office until 2027, when his five-year term ends. He added that he would appoint a new prime minister within days after the resignation on Thursday of the ousted Michel Barnier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Assembly passed a historic no-confidence vote against Barnier, marking the shortest tenure for a prime minister in modern French history. Before Wednesday, only one government had ever been ousted &ndash; that of Georges Pompidou, in October 1962.</p>
<p>In his first public address following the turmoil, Macron criticized the left-wing New Popular Front (NPF) and the right-wing National Rally (RN) opposition for their role in the ousting, calling their alliance an <em>&ldquo;anti-Republican front.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t shoulder other people&rsquo;s irresponsibility,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<p>Despite calls from the opposition for his resignation, the president insisted he would fulfill his mandate and ruled out new elections until at least July, as per the French constitution. The country&rsquo;s constitution does not require a president to step down after his government is ousted.</p>
<p>Back in June Macron also stated his intention to remain in office until May 2027, regardless of the outcomes of the summer snap parliamentary elections he called. At that time Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead, had said only Macron&rsquo;s resignation would avoid a hung parliament for the remaining three years of his term.</p>
<p>He appointed Barnier, a 73-year-old conservative and former Brexit negotiator, in September, angering the NPF, which he&rsquo;d used to sideline the RN. The Macron-backed minority government has clung to power by playing both sides against each other ever since.</p>

<p>Things came to a head over a social security budget proposal in which Barnier tried to cut spending by &euro;40 billion ($41.87 billion) and to raise &euro;20 billion in taxes to deal with a massive deficit. RN threatened a no-confidence vote unless the cabinet made a number of concessions to its <em>&ldquo;red lines.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>France is the second-largest economy in the Eurozone but has <em>&ldquo;a mountain of debt,&rdquo;</em> according to Politico, while <em>&ldquo;its government hasn&rsquo;t been this fragile nor its parliament so fractured for a generation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Barnier will stay on as a caretaker PM until Macron can appoint a replacement. It took the French president nearly two months to do so after July&rsquo;s parliamentary election. Another vote is not an option, because the French constitution forbids this until at least a year has passed.</p>
<p>Despite Macron&rsquo;s bloc coming second in the election, the president has the sole power to name the prime minister, who is not formally required to be a candidate from the dominant party.</p>

                            <p><strong>The group’s leader has accused the US and Israel of supporting jihadists in Syria and called on Arab nations to support Damascus</strong></p>


            <p>Hezbollah will help the Syrian government fight jihadists and is calling on Arab countries to support Damascus in its battle, the acting leader of the Lebanon-based militant group, said in a speech on Thursday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Aggression on Syria is sponsored by America and Israel,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Naim Qassem claimed, adding that Islamists <em>&ldquo;have always been their tools since 2011, when the problem began in Syria.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The country was plunged into a protracted war in 2011, as various anti-government groups sought to topple the government of President Bashar Assad. Jihadist forces, particularly those employing foreign fighters assisted militarily from abroad, emerged as dominant players among the opposition.</p>
<p>The US and other Western nations, which demanded that <em>&ldquo;Assad must go,&rdquo;</em> claimed that <em>&ldquo;moderate rebels&rdquo;</em> could ultimately prevail in the conflict.</p>

<p>Russia intervened in the hostilities in 2015,&nbsp;providing its airpower to Damascus. Assad&rsquo;s forces restored control over most of the country, but some places, including Idlib province near the Turkish border, remain outside of its reach.</p>
<p>The situation deteriorated last week when the Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group (formerly known as Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra) and its allies launched a large-scale surprise attack in the northwestern part of the country.</p>
<p>The insurgents have driven back government forces and captured significant chunks of territory in Aleppo and Idlib, also succeeding in surrounding the key city of Hama earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham, which translates as <em>&ldquo;Organization for the Liberation of the Levant&rdquo;</em> and is commonly known as HTS, is considered a terrorist organization by Syria, Russia, Iran, the US, and other countries.</p>
<p>Hezbollah&rsquo;s Qassem claimed that the US is trying to <em>&ldquo;create chaos in Syria and move Syria from the resistance position to the other hostile position that serves the Israeli enemy,&rdquo;</em> but expressed hopes in Damascus overcoming it.</p>

<p>He also appealed to Arab nations and to the Muslim community, calling on them to help Syria fight against jihadists, and accusing Arabs of silently watching what is happening, comparing it to the war in Gaza and Israeli attacks on Lebanon.</p>
<p>Hezbollah, which also has been designated as a terrorist group by over 20 countries, including most Western ones, began sporadically shelling Israeli territories, proclaiming solidarity with the Palestinians of Gaza.</p>
<p>In early October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon, ramping up airstrikes on Beirut and other cities, and eliminating several high-ranking Hezbollah members, including the group&rsquo;s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. However, a truce took hold last week, under the terms of which the Israel Defense Forces must withdraw from Lebanon within 60 days and cede control of held territory to the Lebanese army, while an international committee will be tasked with adjudicating violation complaints.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Kiev’s officials are seeking to narrow “wide differences” with the US president-elect’s transition team during meetings in Washington</strong></p>


            <p>US President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s transition team is holding high-level talks with Ukrainian officials in Washington but NATO membership for Kiev is unlikely to be on the table, the Wall Street Journal has reported.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky&rsquo;s head of office,&nbsp;Andrey Yermak, met on Wednesday with Trump&rsquo;s choice as special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, as well as incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz.</p>
<p>While Kellogg has publicly expressed support for the Biden administration&rsquo;s move to rush more weapons to Ukraine, believing it will give Trump <em>&ldquo;leverage&rdquo;</em> in future talks with Moscow, there has been little appetite among the president-elect&rsquo;s team to offer Ukraine NATO membership, the paper said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Trump team has shown little interest in offering Ukraine membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,&rdquo;</em> the outlet wrote, noting that Zelensky still considers this a <em>&ldquo;vital security guarantee.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Last week, a statement from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry insisted that membership in the military bloc was <em>&ldquo;the only real security guarantee&rdquo;</em> for the country and that Kiev would not accept <em>&ldquo;any alternatives, surrogates or substitutes&rdquo;</em> for full membership.</p>
<p>During his election campaign, Trump frequently promised he would end the Ukraine conflict within <em>&ldquo;24 hours,&rdquo;</em> but offered few details on how he would accomplish this.</p>
<p>This week, however, Reuters reported that his advisers have now mapped out three possible plans to end the conflict, and all of them include Kiev ceding territory to Moscow and giving up on its aspiration to join NATO.</p>
<p>According to WSJ&rsquo;s report, Yermak traveled to Washington ready to communicate Ukraine&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;readiness for peace.&rdquo;</em> However, one person familiar with Kiev&rsquo;s position told the outlet that it must be a <em>&ldquo;sustainable peace&rdquo;</em> and that a <em>&ldquo;temporary&rdquo;</em> arrangement will not serve US or Ukrainian interests.</p>
<p>Lucian Kim, a Ukraine analyst at International Crisis Group, told the outlet that Kiev might already recognize that NATO membership is not <em>&ldquo;right around the corner&rdquo;</em> but suggested that it may not make sense for them to concede this <em>&ldquo;before negotiations have even started.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>On Thursday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov told CNN that Moscow remains open to hearing Trump&rsquo;s plans, but has not received any concrete proposals. He warned, however, that under no circumstances would Russia compromise on its core national interests.</p>
<p>He also cautioned that the chances for compromise with Ukraine are currently <em>&ldquo;zero&rdquo;</em> and that this won&rsquo;t change until <em>&ldquo;people in Kiev begin to understand there&rsquo;s no way Russia will go the way they&rsquo;ve suggested.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

            <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry has ordered the closure of the Polish consulate general in St. Petersburg and declared its employees personae non grata. The move comes in response to similar action taken by Warsaw.</p>
<p>Moscow has notified Warsaw that the mission will be closed from January 10, 2025 and ordered three Polish diplomats to leave the country before this date.</p>
<p>In October, Warsaw ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in the city of Poznan and the expulsion of its employees after a suspected saboteur was arrested in the city of Wroclaw. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski claimed that Russian intelligence&nbsp;was behind the alleged conspiracy.</p>
<p>Several NATO member countries, including the UK and Poland, have accused Russia of being behind warehouse fires, alleging that unwitting local proxies were being recruited to do Moscow&rsquo;s bidding.</p>
<p>In October, the head of the British Security Service (MI5) claimed that Russia was behind <em>&ldquo;mayhem&rdquo;</em> on British streets, and demanded more funding and greater authority to counter the alleged menace.</p>

<p>Moscow has denied all the allegations as nonsensical. In an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin said that Western politicians were trying to scare their own populations by invoking an imaginary Russian threat in order to distract their attention from domestic troubles.</p>
<p>In Thursday&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1985528/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, the Russian Foreign Ministry explained Moscow&rsquo;s decision to close the Polish consulate.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In recent years, Polish authorities have implemented an openly hostile policy towards Russia, almost completely dismantled the architecture of Russian-Polish relations built over many decades, and have openly declared the need to inflict a &lsquo;strategic defeat&rsquo; on our country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to the ministry, one of the manifestations of this anti-Russian orientation was the closure of the Russian Consulate General in Poznan under a <em>&ldquo;far-fetched pretext.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Moscow has been taking and will continue to take tough countermeasures to any unfriendly steps towards Russia,&rdquo;</em> the statement concludes.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Such speculation will “only make the situation worse,” Russia’s foreign minister has warned</strong></p>


            <p>The ongoing speculation about the potential deployment of troops to Ukraine by Western nations are <em>&ldquo;fantasies&rdquo;</em> that <em>&ldquo;only make the situation worse,&rdquo;</em> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.</p>
<p>The top diplomat delivered the remarks on Thursday during a press conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) ministerial meeting in Malta.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I believe that all these fantasies only make the situation worse and show that the people who are running around with such ideas stubbornly prefer not to hear the very clear warnings that [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin has repeatedly made publicly,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov stated.</p>
<p>The remarks come amid a string of media reports that suggested France and the UK have been considering deploying their troops to Ukraine. The force is reportedly supposed to act as peacekeepers to observe a ceasefire in the event of Moscow and Kiev engaging in talks. The topic has been also invoked by the German leadership, yet Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said the deployment of the country&rsquo;s troops to Ukraine was <em>&ldquo;out of the question&rdquo;</em> before a <em>&ldquo;real ceasefire&rdquo;</em> was achieved.</p>

<p>Lavrov also reiterated that Moscow welcomes any constructive initiatives to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end. However, Russia does not believe any Western-based organizations will be of any help, and is seeking to strengthen security for everyone in <em>&ldquo;our whole continent&rdquo;</em> of Eurasia, he said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;All those initiatives floated by our partners on different continents, which are aimed at finding a political solution, they, of course, must take into account the issue of ensuring the security interests of each country and, of course, the issue of respecting human rights,&rdquo;</em> the top diplomat stressed.</p>
<p>Relations between Russia and the collective West have changed and will not return to the situation prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in early 2022, Lavrov warned.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;All the previous years after the end of the Cold War, the West agreed on some right things, rhetorically praised these right things, but in reality grossly violated all the agreements and did everything to suppress the legitimate interests of Russia,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Hungarian FM Peter Szijjarto has applauded US President-elect Donald Trump’s desire to end the fighting</strong></p>


            <p>US President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s plans to resolve the Ukraine conflict could soon become a reality and Budapest intends to help the Republican achieve that goal, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto has said.</p>
<p>Following a meeting in Washington on Wednesday with Trump&rsquo;s candidate for National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, Szijjarto noted that the current US administration under President Joe Biden appears to only wish to prolong the Ukraine conflict and is trying to make it harder to establish peace after Trump takes office in January.</p>
<p>Szijjarto stated that in the US, the Democrats appear to be <em>&ldquo;on the side of war&rdquo;</em> while the Republican party is <em>&ldquo;on the side of peace.&rdquo;</em> Because of this, the issue of establishing peace in Ukraine became one of the key topics in his conversations with Waltz, the Hungarian diplomat said.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;The American Republicans and we, Hungarian patriots, think similarly, and even in some cases completely identically, about the most important things in the world,&rdquo;</em> Szijjarto said, noting that this provides a <em>&ldquo;very stable basis&rdquo;</em> for future bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The diplomat added that Hungary is <em>&ldquo;pressing hard so that Donald Trump&rsquo;s goal of ending this war quickly becomes a reality,&rdquo;</em> and warned that failure to achieve peace in Ukraine would increase the risk of escalation on a daily basis.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We can only hope that nothing will happen in Ukraine before January 20 that will irreversibly change the situation and significantly complicate efforts to achieve peace,&rdquo;</em> the Hungarian minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moscow has said that it has yet to receive a detailed plan from Trump or his team regarding a potential resolution of the conflict. However, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has stated in an interview with CNN that Russia would carefully examine such a plan when it is submitted, but noted that it would not agree to any concessions that compromise its national security interests.</p>
<p>Ryabkov also issued a warning to the outgoing Biden administration that Russia would respond to any provocations and urged the West not to underestimate Moscow&rsquo;s resolve to defend its core interests using all means necessary.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Cyril Ramaphosa says he has invited the US president-elect to play golf and talk about global matters</strong></p>


            <p>The G20 has enough <em>&ldquo;shock absorbers&rdquo;</em> in place to function effectively if Donald Trump pursues an &lsquo;America First&rsquo; policy at the cost of international cooperation after taking office as US president, South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa has said.</p>
<p>He made the statement during the official launch of his country&rsquo;s presidency of the Group of 20 major economies in Cape Town on Tuesday. Pretoria assumed the rotating leadership of the G20 this month, succeeding Brazil at the group&rsquo;s November summit in Rio de Janeiro. The US set to take over in December 2025.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa has promised to advance Africa and the Global South&rsquo;s development priorities, including addressing the impacts of climate change. However, US President-elect Trump, who is set to take office on January 20, is said to oppose international cooperation on climate issues.</p>
<p>In response to a question about how prepared the G20 is for a likely Trump &lsquo;America First&rsquo; approach in his second administration, Ramaphosa told the Associated Press: <em>&ldquo;I think there will be sufficient shock absorbers that will enable the G20 to continue to function.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The US president-elect has vowed to use tariffs to settle American trade deficits, force offshore manufacturers to return, and achieve a range of geopolitical goals under a foreign policy that Western media describes as <em>&ldquo;combative.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has also threatened to impose 100% tariffs on goods from BRICS countries if they establish a new currency or support an existing one as a rival to the US dollar. BRICS previously comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and was expanded in January to include Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates. Around 30 other nations have expressed interest in joining the group of emerging economies, according to Moscow.</p>

<p>Leaders of the economic bloc, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazil&rsquo;s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, have previously expressed support for the possible creation of an international reserve currency for trading within the group. Last month, however, Putin said it was too early to discuss a common BRICS currency because the economies of member states needed further development and integration first. Following Trump&rsquo;s threat, South Africa has also denied that the bloc was planning to create a new currency.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Ramaphosa said his government will <em>&ldquo;seek to get sufficient consensus on decisions that need to be taken by the G20.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are advancing the interests of the people of the world,&rdquo;</em> he was quoted by the AP as saying.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa also announced that he has invited Trump to South Africa for a state visit and to the G20 summit in Africa&rsquo;s most developed economy in late 2025, where the US leader will take on the intergovernmental forum&rsquo;s chairmanship role. <br /> <br /><em>&ldquo;If he has time&hellip; President Trump and possibly myself can go and play golf and talk about global matters,&rdquo;</em> Ramaphosa said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>As global powers compete for dominance over vast resources and strategic routes, China and India too are eager to take on a larger role in this pivotal region</strong></p>


            <p>The Arctic region, still relatively unexplored, is recognized as a rich repository of untapped natural resources, particularly oil, gas, and marine life. It is also historically viewed as a potential flashpoint for great-power conflict.</p>
<p>Russia has long maintained a dominant presence in the area. However, NATO&rsquo;s expansion northward has compelled Moscow to significantly increase its military footprint. Growing superpower China has shown an escalating interest in Arctic affairs, while India, despite its geographical distance, has also established a foothold in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With increased US confrontation with both China and Russia, these two powers have fostered greater cooperation and coordination in Arctic matters.</p>
<p>Covering over one sixth of the Earth&rsquo;s landmass, the Arctic region encompasses the North Pole and is characterized by vast expanses of floating ice, with ridges that can reach up to 20 meters thick. It is estimated to hold nearly 22% of the world&rsquo;s undiscovered oil and natural gas reserves, with Russia accounting for 52% of the Arctic&rsquo;s total energy resources and Norway holding 12%. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Global industrialization and rising emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have resulted in increased temperatures, leading to rapid glacial melting. In 2024, the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice was recorded at 4.28 million square kilometers &ndash; approximately 1.8 million square kilometers below the long-term average. The rate of sea ice reduction is nearly 13% per decade, suggesting that the Arctic could become ice-free during the summer by 2040. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The consequences of melting ice are profound, potentially raising sea levels and threatening many island territories and coastal cities. Climate change and global warming have garnered international attention, highlighted by discussions at recent forums such as COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Antarctica, which is governed by a 1959 treaty allowing only peaceful activities, no analogous treaty exists for the Arctic. Established in 1996, the Arctic Council addresses issues pertinent to Arctic nations, comprising the United States, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Observer countries must acknowledge the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Arctic states while recognizing the extensive legal framework governing the Arctic Ocean. In May 2013, India became the 11th country to gain permanent observer status at the Arctic Council.</p>
<p>Both Russia and the United States have long maintained military bases and surveillance systems in the Arctic, including nuclear deterrent capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia has operated nuclear-powered icebreakers in the region for some time. Although the Arctic Military Environmental Cooperation (AMEC) agreement between Russia, the US, and Norway facilitated the decommissioning of certain Soviet and US assets, the increasing interest from additional nations has sparked a new Cold War dynamics between the two primary powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cooperative atmosphere that once prevailed has deteriorated, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions stemming from the situation in Ukraine since 2014. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Arctic Sea Routes</strong></h2>
<p>Increased ice melting has begun opening the Arctic region for longer periods of time in summer months. There are <a href="https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2012/2012-scholarly-papers/20-the-future-of-arctic-shipping-along-the-transpolar-sea-route">three main routes</a> that could revolutionise the international commercial shipping industry in the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Northern Sea Route (NSR) lies along the arctic coast of Russia. Ice clears up here first and therefore is available for longer. It also has the highest commercial potential: the route reduces the maritime distance between East Asia and Europe from 21,000 kilometres via the Suez Canal to 12,800 km. It implies a transit time saving&nbsp;of&nbsp;10-15 days. NSR was used extensively for natural resource extraction and transportation during the Soviet Era.</p>
<p>In 2009, two German ships led by a Russian icebreaker made the first commercial journey across the NSR from Busan in South Korea, to Rotterdam in Netherlands, establishing good commercial prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North West Passage (NWP) is another route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, crossing Canada&rsquo;s Arctic Archipelago that was first used in 2007. It may open for more regular use soon. While Canada claims it as an internal waterway, the US and others insist it is an international transit passage, and must allow free and unencumbered movement.</p>
<p>This route could&nbsp; reduce shipping time between the Middle East and Western Europe to around 13,600 km compared to 24,000 km via the Panama Canal, however parts of the route are just 15 metres deep, thus reducing its viability. China seems to be interested in using this passage to eastern parts of US, as the Panama Canal too has ship size and tonnage restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third one is a potential Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) which could use the central part of the Arctic to directly link the Bering Strait and the Atlantic Ocean port of Murmansk. This route is hypothetical for now and may appear as climate change progresses.</p>
<h2><strong>Moscow&rsquo;s strategy&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Russia is the largest stakeholder in the Arctic, a region that <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-2274?d=/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-2274&amp;p=emailAoCR7Bfp2GueU%23:~:text=The%2520Arctic%2520provides%252080%2525%2520of,exports%2520(Buchanan,%25202023).">contributes</a> approximately 10% of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for 20% of all Russian exports. &nbsp;The Arctic has <a href="https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/arctic-2023-russian-foreign-policy-concept/">gained renewed significance</a> in the 2023 version of the Kremlin&rsquo;s Foreign Policy Concept, which emphasizes the preservation of peace and stability, increased environmental sustainability, and reduced threats to national security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) remains a key objective, with Russia reaffirming its commitment to international law in the Arctic. The Concept reinforces the authority of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to govern interstate relations in the Arctic Ocean and expresses Russia&rsquo;s openness to <em>&ldquo;mutually beneficial cooperation with non-Arctic states that pursue a constructive policy towards Russia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s New Arctic Policy 2035, signed in 2020, explicitly asserts its sovereignty and territorial integrity over the NSR, much to the dismay of the United States, which advocates for the NSR to remain an international waterway under broader Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moscow has threatened to use force against vessels that do not comply with Russian regulations in the NSR. Despite Russian overtures suggesting a willingness to cooperate, the West consistently portrays Russia as the villain in narratives about the Arctic.</p>
<h2><strong>A new player</strong></h2>
<p>China, which considers itself a <em>&ldquo;Near-Arctic State,&rdquo;</em> seeks to be a stakeholder in the Arctic. In January 2018, China released its official Arctic Policy paper, highlighting its interests in Arctic resources and the need to develop infrastructure for research, military, and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China invests more than the United States in Arctic research and operates a Polar Research Institute in Shanghai. It possesses a fleet of research vessels and two MV Xue Long icebreakers. Additionally, China established the Arctic Yellow River Station in 2004. In 2018, COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited, based in Shanghai, made eight transits through the Arctic between Europe and China.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Polar Silk Road,&rdquo;</em> launched in 2018 as a joint initiative with Russia, aims to enhance connectivity in the region. Like Russia, China also aspires to deploy nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Arctic, becoming only the second country to do so. However, Denmark, encouraged by the United States, rejected China&rsquo;s offer to purchase an old military base in Greenland and build an international airport there.</p>
<h2><strong>India&rsquo;s interest&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>As a rising major power, India aims to become a significant player in the Arctic. It has operated the <em>&ldquo;Himadri&rdquo;</em> permanent Arctic research station in Svalbard, Norway, since July 2008. Svalbard, the northernmost year-round settlement on Earth, has a population of about 2,200 and is nearly 1,200 kilometers from the North Pole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India&rsquo;s research focuses on monitoring fjord dynamics, glaciers, carbon recycling, glaciology, geology, atmospheric pollution, and space weather, among other areas. In 2014, India established an underwater moored observatory called <em>&ldquo;IndARC&rdquo;</em> in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, aiming to find linkages between Arctic meteorological parameters and the southwest monsoon. Additionally, India&rsquo;s ONGC Videsh has shown interest in investing in Russia&rsquo;s Arctic liquefied natural gas projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s Arctic policy, titled <em>&ldquo;India and the Arctic: Building a Partnership for Sustainable Development,&rdquo;</em> was released in March 2022. This document outlines India&rsquo;s interests, which include economic and resource prospects, sea connectivity, and reinforcing its presence in the region.</p>
<p>The Arctic becomes increasingly important for New Delhi as it seeks to expand sea trade routes to access more markets for its growing exports, and secure passages for shipments of oil and other vital commodities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Both India and Russia have made significant progress in&nbsp;promoting the&nbsp;7,200 kilometre International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) that could move freight between India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe, greatly reducing cost and time, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/india/607886-sea-transport-corridor-india-russia/">Chennai-Vladivostok corridor,</a> which could become a part of NSR.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/india/605563-russia-icebreakers-ship-india-rosatom/">Recent developments</a> indicate that New Delhi is engaged in discussions with Moscow regarding the construction of icebreakers at Indian shipyards, highlighting India&rsquo;s commitment to Arctic engagement and the potential for expanded cooperation.</p>
<p>India may also explore mining opportunities in the Arctic region. Despite widespread international calls for a moratorium on deep-sea mining. Notably, Norway aims to be the first nation to initiate commercial activities in this domain &ndash; a critical move given its membership in the Arctic Council and significant role in Arctic geopolitics.</p>
<h2><strong>The next great game</strong></h2>
<p>The Arctic continues to attract researchers, as <em>&ldquo;the next great game&rdquo;</em> unfolds. Unlike Antarctica, Arctic states possess established territorial claims under the Law of the Sea regime. Consequently, discussions surrounding great power politics, competition, and conflict in the Arctic are increasingly capturing the attention of strategic analysts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s Northern Fleet is strategically positioned across the Arctic and holds a dominant stance in the region. The US became an Arctic state following its purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867. Canada and Northern European nations have substantial stakes in Arctic affairs, prompting the US to deepen its alliances with these countries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) offers a transportation route that is 37% shorter for cargo traveling from London to Yokohama, Japan, compared to the Suez Canal. Russia <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/603518-russia-far-east-putin/">seeks to leverage</a> this advantage economically through a robust support infrastructure along its Arctic coastline. Moscow perceives the US and its NATO partners as threats to its Arctic ambitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the great Arctic race progresses, Russia&rsquo;s resource-driven economy leads in exploitation efforts, having secured rights to approximately 1.7 million square kilometers of seabed. Moreover, Russia has revived several Soviet-era military bases and modernized its naval capabilities, now operating seven nuclear-powered icebreakers alongside around 30 diesel-powered vessels. In contrast, the US and China each operate only two diesel-powered icebreakers. NATO has also intensified military exercises in the Barents Sea and Scandinavian regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China views the Arctic as a vital source for energy and minerals, while India hopes for a collaborative regional approach rather than conflict. Nonetheless, the intensifying global competition between the US, Russia, and China is already manifesting significant consequences.</p>
<p>While the US holds the title of global superpower, Russia has emerged as the preeminent power in the Arctic. With strong ties to Russia and a recent order for four icebreakers, India is well-positioned to play a relevant role in Arctic affairs.

                            <p><strong>The German chancellor claims his government’s employment scheme has partially succeeded, but can be improved</strong></p>


            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he wants as many Ukrainian refugees as possible in the country to start work and dismissed criticisms suggesting that his government&rsquo;s efforts to bolster employment among these recent arrivals have failed.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s economic powerhouse has emerged as a prime destination for Ukrainian refugees in the EU since the conflict between Moscow and Kiev escalated in February 2022. According to various estimates, more than a million people from the Eastern European country are currently residing in Germany.</p>
<p>In late October, Stern magazine estimated that approximately 720,000 Ukrainians were receiving &lsquo;Burgergeld&rsquo;, or citizen&rsquo;s benefits, reportedly costing the German taxpayers &euro;539 million per month.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session in the German parliament on Wednesday, an opposition MP from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) called into question the effectiveness of the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Job Turbo&rsquo; employment scheme, aimed at Ukrainian refugees in particular. Scholz responded by claiming that the initiative has raised the number of working refugees, while acknowledging that <em>&ldquo;this cannot suffice yet.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The chancellor stated that <em>&ldquo;so many [refugees] have been [staying] here for so long, and they must actually get started now.&rdquo;</em> He pointed out that he has discussed the issue at length with Vladimir Zelensky, who Scholz says is planning to <em>&ldquo;establish a Ukrainian agency in Germany and in Poland, which would support Ukrainians either in their return [home] or in employment in Germany.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We must look at ways to ensure that as many [Ukrainian refugees] as possible look for work after all the measures toward language acquisition and other things have taken place,&rdquo;</em> the chancellor concluded.</p>
<p>In September, Scholz had <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/603673-germany-scholz-wants-ukrainians-work/">stated</a> that <em>&ldquo;it is my wish that [Ukrainians] work.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The following month, Stern, citing analysis by the Federal Audit Office, reported that the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Job Turbo&rsquo; initiative had largely failed, accounting for <em>&ldquo;less than one percent of recruitments [among refugees] registered in 2024.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The media outlet quoted the auditors&rsquo; analysis as highlighting <em>&ldquo;considerable deficiencies in job-centers&rsquo; integration efforts,&rdquo;</em> with counseling actually having been provided in around a third of the cases this year. This, in turn, has reportedly led to refugees increasingly dropping out of the integration courses. <br /> Launched last October, Job Turbo was touted as a tool that could wean as many as 400,000 refugees, both from Ukraine and elsewhere, off government handouts.</p>
<p>According to Stern, as of June 2024, only 30% of Ukrainian refugees were employed in Germany &ndash; far below the figures recorded in neighboring countries.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The flagship cryptocurrency has been rallying on investor expectations of a pro-crypto Trump administration</strong></p>


            <p>The price of Bitcoin has smashed the long-awaited $100,000 threshold as part of a rally fueled by investor expectations of crypto-friendly policies from US President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>The flagship cryptocurrency rose as high as $103,844 per coin late on Wednesday. It was trading at $103,173 on Thursday, up by more than 7% as of 14:54 GMT.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is now up more than 140% in 2024, with a significant part of these gains coming with the post-election rally.</p>
<p>At over $2 trillion, Bitcoin is now the seventh-largest financial asset by market capitalization, surpassing energy giant Saudi Aramco and moving closer to tech giants Amazon and Google. Overall, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies stood at around $3.8 trillion on Thursday, up by more than 131% in annual terms.</p>
<p>The latest milestone comes as Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates the cryptocurrency sector. A crypto advocate and former SEC commissioner, Atkins will replace Gary Gensler, who has long led a crackdown on the industry. During his campaign, Trump has pledged to unseat Gensler.</p>
<p>Once a crypto skeptic himself, Trump has changed his stance, claiming he would make the US the <em>&ldquo;crypto capital of the planet,&rdquo;</em> and insisting that all Bitcoin should be mined in the country. He even used Bitcoin to buy cheeseburgers and beer for his supporters at a New York City bar.</p>
<p>Last month, it was reported that Trump&rsquo;s social media company was holding talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt.</p>

<p>Many analysts have long predicted that Bitcoin could surge past the historic milestone. However, some of them have had mixed reactions to the latest rally.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Individual investors must be excited to see the BTC price top $100,000 following the news of Paul Atkins being nominated as SEC chair,&rdquo;</em> Shoki Omori, chief Japan desk strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters. <br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean BTC will rally forever, as there will be moves to take profits,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at BTSE in Hong Kong, Bitcoin could reach <em>&ldquo;even greater heights&rdquo;</em> as more institutions begin to perceive it as a viable store of value, and allocate funds to Bitcoin ETFs.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Jewish state is intent on “physically destroying” Palestinians, Amnesty International has claimed</strong></p>


            <p>Human rights group Amnesty International has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, in a damning report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Titled &lsquo;You Feel Like You Are Subhuman: Israel&rsquo;s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza&rsquo;, the document describes the <em>&ldquo;killing of civilians, destruction of civilian infrastructure, forcible displacement, the obstruction or denial of life-saving goods and humanitarian aid by Israel in Gaza&rdquo;</em> since October last year.</p>
<p>Hostilities between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian enclave flared up when the militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,100 people and taking more than 200 hostages. The massive military retaliation by Israel has claimed more than 44,5000 lives in the enclave, according to Gaza health officials.</p>

<p>Israel&rsquo;s relentless destruction in Gaza has caused the displacement of about 1.9 million Palestinians &ndash; more than 90% of the territory&rsquo;s population, according to the UN.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them,&rdquo;</em> said Agn&egrave;s Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International. Israel has been acting <em>&ldquo;with total impunity,&rdquo;</em> she added.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Hamas-Israel war, multiple international organizations have accused Israel of inhumane actions in Gaza.</p>
<p>Last month the UN Human Rights Office reported that nearly 70% of verified victims over a six-month period were women and children. The number raised concerns of <em>&ldquo;war crimes and other possible atrocity crimes,&rdquo;</em> the agency said.</p>
<p>The International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant last month, accusing them of criminal responsibility for acts including murder, persecution and starvation used as a weapon of war <em>&ldquo;against the civilian population of Gaza&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;Israel rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions leveled against it by ICC,&rdquo;</em> Netanyahu said in response at the time.</p>
<p>Israeli officials have argued that their actions in Gaza are lawful, and justified by the military goal of eradicating Hamas.</p>
<p>Also in November, the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis, called for an investigation to determine whether Israel&rsquo;s attacks on Gaza amounted to genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>In its report on Thursday, Amnesty International warned Israel&rsquo;s key arms suppliers, the US and Germany, that they are <em>&ldquo;violating their obligation to prevent genocide&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;becoming complicit.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It urged them, as well as other EU member states and the UK, to <em>&ldquo;act now to bring Israel&rsquo;s atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza to an immediate end.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

            <p>An RT crew has traveled to southern Lebanon, days after the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced.</p>
<p>The armistice was enacted last Wednesday, following 14 months of hostilities. The fighting has waned but has not stopped entirely, with both sides already repeatedly accusing each other of violations.</p>
<p>RT&rsquo;s Steve Sweeney spoke to the residents of Maarakeh, a Lebanese village located to the east of the city of Tyre. The settlement has been seriously damaged by Israeli shelling, with multiple buildings destroyed during the hostilities.</p>
<p>The village is adorned with the flags of the Hezbollah group, with locals expressing strong support and readiness to continue fighting Israel. The villagers paid tribute to those who had lost their lives in the fighting, with 11 men from Maarakeh alone killed in the hostilities.</p>

                            <p><strong>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has been barred from attending an OSCE meeting in Malta</strong></p>


            <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has denounced Western pressure that resulted in a last-minute refusal to let the ministry&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, travel to Malta for an international event.</p>
<p>This week, Valletta is hosting a foreign ministers&rsquo; meeting of member states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a security and human rights body. Zakharova was supposed to be part of the Russian delegation.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the spokeswoman announced that she would not be present at the two-day gathering, due to what she called <em>&ldquo;scheming of the Western hydra&rdquo;</em> against Russian diplomats.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Maltese issued a visa. But today, almost at the moment before the plane took off, they revoked their own decision and annulled the visa, citing &lsquo;circumstances outside their control&rsquo;,&rdquo;</em> she said.</p>
<p>The incident amounted to <em>&ldquo;abuse of the function of the OSCE chairmanship,&rdquo;</em> Lavrov said on Thursday, referring to Malta&rsquo;s current role in the organization. Speaking to his counterparts, the foreign minister said the decision fits a pattern of discrimination against Russia, which undermines the OSCE&rsquo;s core mandate.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am issuing this warning in full seriousness: the OSCE exists while there is consensus, while each state&rsquo;s interests are guaranteed,&rdquo;</em> the top diplomat said. <em>&ldquo;Now there are neither consensus nor guarantees left.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Washington was not satisfied with having NATO and the EU, so it has fully subjected&hellip; the OSCE secretariat. And that is not the end of it.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Maltese Foreign Ministry said three EU members refused to agree to a special waiver, which would have allowed the Russian official to fly to the Mediterranean island nation despite being on the EU&rsquo;s personal sanctions list, the Times of Malta reported. The ministry did not name the countries, but the paper cited sources as claiming that Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were behind Zakharova&rsquo;s visa trouble.</p>

<p>Latvia and Lithuania are boycotting the meeting due to Lavrov&rsquo;s presence, the newspaper added.</p>
<p>Zakharova said the situation was similar to what happened in November 2023, when Bulgaria refused to let a Russian government plane pass through its airspace because the spokeswoman was on board. The flight&rsquo;s destination was Skopje, North Macedonia, which was hosting that year&rsquo;s OSCE Ministerial Council.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The chancellor shook hands with the injured fighter during an official visit to Ukraine</strong></p>


            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has met with a member of a Ukrainian military unit believed to have neo-Nazi links, during his visit to the country this week. Video footage of Scholz with the wounded fighter was posted on X by Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.</p>
<p>The German head of government visited Ukraine on Monday, where he held talks with Zelensky that were preceded by a joint visit to a hospital where wounded military personnel are being treated.</p>
<p>Commenting on Scholz&rsquo;s visit, X user Moss Robeson, who claims to be an independent researcher of Ukrainian fascism and Nazism, wrote that Zelensky had introduced the German official to an injured <em>&ldquo;fighter from the 🇺🇦National Guard battalion affiliated with the far-right Svoboda party.&rdquo;</em> According to the post, the party has ties to German neo-Nazi party &lsquo;Der Dritte Weg&rsquo; (The Third Way).</p>
<p>A readout on the German chancellor&rsquo;s website quotes him as reiterating Berlin&rsquo;s unwavering support for Kiev during a joint press conference with Zelensky on Monday. Scholz added that his focus was on ensuring that Ukraine would be negotiating from a favorable position during any potential talks with Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin has long maintained that far-right elements have infiltrated the Ukrainian military and public authorities, and has described the <em>&ldquo;denazification&rdquo;</em> of the country as one of its ongoing military campaign&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<p>The Azov battalion is among the most notable examples of these tendencies, Moscow says.</p>
<p>Established as a volunteer unit in 2014 and incorporated into Ukraine&rsquo;s National Guard a year later, Azov infamously uses banners with the Wolfsangel symbol, which was also used by several German divisions during World War II, including the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich.</p>

<p>Many of its fighters are known active and former members of ultranationalist and neo-Nazi groups, as well as groups of far-right football hooligans.</p>
<p>The battalion&rsquo;s co-founder is prominent Ukrainian nationalist and white supremacist Andrey Biletsky.</p>
<p>Azov has been accused of committing war crimes in Donbass during the course of the armed conflict there that started in 2014. It has been formally designated a terrorist organization by Russian authorities.</p>
<p>In early 2023, Biletsky set up the 3rd Assault Brigade, which is made up of numerous Azov members. This unit has since attempted to water down its far-right imagery, even staging a public-relations tour across Europe this summer.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian brigade had to cancel planned events in such cities as Berlin, Rotterdam, Brussels and Cologne amid a backlash from local left-wing activists and politicians.</p>
<p>Commenting on the unit&rsquo;s PR exercise, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called it a <em>&ldquo;disgusting phenomenon.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Moscow will consider the US president-elect’s ideas but will not compromise on its national interests, Sergey Ryabkov has warned</strong></p>


            <p>Russia is open to hearing US President-elect Donald Trump&rsquo;s plans for resolving the Ukraine conflict, but has not yet received any concrete proposals, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has told CNN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that he&nbsp;could end the fighting between Russia and Ukraine in just 24 hours once he assumes office. However, since his victory in the presidential election last month, Moscow has not had any direct contact with Trump or his team regarding the issue, Ryabkov said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diplomat stressed that Russia will examine the future US president&rsquo;s ideas once he is ready to present them, but stressed that Moscow will under no circumstances compromise on its core national interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interview, Ryabkov also said there is currently <em>&ldquo;zero&rdquo;</em> chance of a compromise between Moscow and Kiev, as the positions laid out by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky appear to be <em>&ldquo;incompatible.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The moment people in Kiev begin to understand there&rsquo;s no way Russia will go the way they suggested &ndash; there might be openings and opportunities,&rdquo;</em> the diplomat told CNN.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryabkov also stated that the current geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West are at an unprecedented level, even compared to the height of the Cold War, and expressed concern that the associated risks continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deputy minister cautioned that there is <em>&ldquo;no magic solution&rdquo;</em> to the conflict and accused the West of lacking common sense, restraint and <em>&ldquo;sober analysis,&rdquo;</em> while underestimating Russia&rsquo;s resolve to defend its core security interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We have not lost our senses. We will not let ourselves be provoked into anything,&rdquo;</em> Ryabkov said, adding that Russia nevertheless has the <em>&ldquo;stamina and strong will&rdquo;</em> to defend its national interest <em>&ldquo;with all means,&rdquo;</em> regardless of how much money the US burns in the conflict, or what <em>&ldquo;people in the EU believe they should do to support Kiev.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We will prevail there, no doubt,&rdquo;</em> the diplomat said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ryabkov went on to stress that Russia could eventually be forced to resort to <em>&ldquo;even stronger military means&rdquo;</em> than it has so far, if Washington fails to recognize that <em>&ldquo;Moscow cannot be pressurized indefinitely.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also issued a warning to the outgoing Biden administration, stressing that Russia would respond to any provocations and <em>&ldquo;find a way to assert our strong will.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The conversation between Valery Gerasimov and Charles Q. Brown Jr took place last week</strong></p>


            <p>Russia&rsquo;s Chief of General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, had held a phone call&nbsp;with the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Charles Q. Brown Jr, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has said. General Gerasimov last spoke with his American counterpart in March 2023.</p>
<p>The phone conversation between the countries&rsquo; top generals took place on November 27, the ministry said in a statement on Thursday, when Gerasimov warned Brown about missile exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;During the conversation, the US side was informed about the exercises in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea by the Russian Navy and Aerospace Forces groupings, involving live-fire drills and launches of high-precision missiles,&rdquo;</em> the statement read.</p>
<p>The warning was made by Gerasimov <em>&ldquo;to prevent possible incidents in connection with the presence of US and NATO ships near the area of the Russian exercise,&rdquo;</em> it added.</p>

<p>The drills in question took place on Tuesday, when Russian vessels launched new ship-based Tsirkon hypersonic missiles, the Defense Ministry said in a previous statement.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Brown&rsquo;s spokesman, Captain JD Dorsey, confirmed media reports about the two military leaders holding a conversation a week ago.<br />Gerasimov and Brown <em>&ldquo;discussed a number of global and regional security issues, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,&rdquo;</em> Dorsey told ABC.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This was the first time the leaders spoke since General Brown became chairman&rdquo;</em> in October 2023, he noted.</p>
<p>After the escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022, Gerasimov communicated several times with Brown&rsquo;s predecessor as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.</p>
<p>The latest phone call remained undisclosed because <em>&ldquo;at the request of General Gerasimov, General Brown agreed to not proactively announce the call,&rdquo;</em> Dorsey said.</p>

<p>The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed US military and defense officials, that the two generals had <em>&ldquo;talked about how to manage escalation concerns between the two countries&rdquo;</em> during their conversation.</p>
<p>One of the sources claimed that they had discussed Russia&rsquo;s recent use of a new Oreshnik medium-range hypersonic ballistic missile to strike a Ukrainian military-industrial facility last month.</p>
<p>According to Moscow, the deployment of the state-of-the-art system was a response to Washington and its allies allowing Ukraine to target internationally recognized Russian territory with the long-range weapons they supply to Kiev.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin warned at the time that, if the Ukrainian attacks deep inside Russia continue, the authorities in Moscow reserve the right <em>&ldquo;to use our weapons against military facilities of those countries that allow the use of their weapons against our facilities.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The countries expect to launch trial runs on the rail link in March 2025, Energy Minister Awais Leghari has told RT</strong></p>


            <p>Russia and Pakistan are set to be linked by a new freight train line as bilateral talks expand, Islamabad&rsquo;s Energy Minister Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari has stated in an interview with RT.</p>
<p>Pakistan&rsquo;s ambassador to Moscow, Muhammad Khalid Jamali, first expressed his country&rsquo;s readiness to join the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200 km-long route connecting Russia and Central Asia with India via Iran, at this summer&rsquo;s International IT Forum in Khanty-Mansiysk.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As early as March next year, the first south-north train trial run will transport goods from Russia to Pakistan via Iran and Azerbaijan,&rdquo;</em> Leghari relayed.</p>
<p>In the interview, Leghari also mentioned ongoing talks between Moscow and Islamabad regarding the establishment of direct air service between the two countries, highlighting <em>&ldquo;interest from both sides&rdquo;</em> to establish airline connectivity <em>&ldquo;very soon.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Bilateral transport and logistics projects were discussed between the countries in October during the visit of a delegation from Russia&rsquo;s Federation Council to Islamabad. Chairwoman Valentina Matvienko emphasized the importance of new logistics corridors and welcomed Pakistan&rsquo;s interest in this project.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;It has both political and economic dimensions that Pakistan and Russia haven&rsquo;t seen for a while,&rdquo;</em> Leghari asserted. The minister stressed the significance of several initiatives being discussed by the two governments, as they <em>&ldquo;make it easier for our people to interact, and for businesses to flourish and communicate.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Islamabad and Moscow signed eight memorandums of understanding covering various sectors, including health, trade, industrial cooperation, and education. These agreements were reached during the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Commission, which was established about a decade ago.</p>
<p>Both Islamabad and Moscow have previously expressed their commitment to expanding cooperation, particularly in trade. Russia&rsquo;s ambassador to Pakistan indicated in January that <em>&ldquo;bilateral trade is showing positive dynamics.&rdquo;</em> Trade turnover between the two nations stands at approximately $1 billion. <br /> However, Leghari noted that <em>&ldquo;there is a trade imbalance between Russia and Pakistan, and a serious one.&rdquo;</em><br /> <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wanting to also work towards an environment where the balance is more balanced,&rdquo;</em> he told RT, noting that Pakistan, as a large producer of agricultural commodities, could be an important provider of food to Russia.</p>
<p>Pakistan has also <a href="https://news.az/news/pakistans-strategic-move-joining-the-international-north-south-transport-corridor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed</a> that Russia participate in oil and gas exploration on its shelf, as well as in oil refining, according to Moscow&rsquo;s Deputy Energy Minister Roman Marshavin. <em>&ldquo;Stable supplies of Russian oil to Pakistan are ongoing, and all technical and financial issues are being promptly resolved by both sides,&rdquo;</em> he said, adding that work is underway to increase these supplies and diversify the range of products.<br /><br /></p>

                            <p><strong>The country’s Arctic region contains vast oil and gas reserves, Rosneft’s Igor Sechin has said</strong></p>


            <p>The value of Russia&rsquo;s natural wealth stands at $100 trillion, double that of the US, the head of Russian oil major Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said at an economic forum in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sechin described the Arctic as a <em>&ldquo;treasure trove of natural resources,&rdquo;</em> not just for Russia but also for the world. According to the Rosneft chief, more than 20% of the planet&rsquo;s undiscovered oil and natural gas reserves are in the Arctic, while the Russian Arctic contains 80% of those reserves. <br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This imposes a huge responsibility on Russia,&rdquo;</em> Sechin told the Verona Eurasian Economic Forum in the city of Ras Al-Khaimah. <br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Arctic should be completely free of conflicts and foreign interference, given the strategic importance of this region for the energy security of all Eurasia,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>Eight countries span into the Arctic, including Russia. The other seven nations &ndash; Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US &ndash; are all NATO members. The eight countries form the so-called Arctic Council, a group that promotes regional cooperation and whose mandate explicitly excludes military security.</p>

                            <p><strong>Earlier this year, G7 countries agreed to lend Kiev the funds, secured by frozen Russian sovereign assets</strong></p>


            <p>The EU is willing to support Kiev&rsquo;s war effort and compensate for a potential US withdrawal from a $50 billion G7 loan deal, as uncertainty grows over Washington&rsquo;s commitments under the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump, Politico reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Polish Deputy Finance Minister Pawel Karbownik raised the concerns at an event marking Warsaw&rsquo;s upcoming presidency of the EU Council, the outlet said.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is a risk that Donald Trump will pull out of the $50 billion agreement,&rdquo;</em> Karbownik said, urging the US president-elect to clarify his stance, to allow the EU time to develop a contingency plan.</p>
<p>The US and its allies froze an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. In June, G7 members pledged a $50 billion loan for Kiev, with the frozen Russian assets to be used as collateral, to help Kiev buy weapons and rebuild damaged infrastructure.</p>
<p>Karbownik gave his reaction after US House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed on Wednesday President Joe Biden&rsquo;s request to include $24 billion in additional aid to Ukraine in a government funding bill.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have a newly elected president and we&rsquo;re going to wait and take the new commander-in-chief&rsquo;s direction on all of that,&rdquo;</em> Johnson said. <em>&ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t expect any Ukraine funding to come up now.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>According to the G7 agreement, finalized in October, the US and EU are to allocate $20 billion each, with the UK, Canada, and Japan contributing the remainder. The loan is to be repaid using interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets.</p>
<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s potential withdrawal threatens to derail the deal, forcing the EU to act alone, the outlet noted.</p>
<p>Karbownik suggested that in a worst-case scenario the bloc will <em>&ldquo;make provisions as the EU to ensure that the $50 billion goes to Ukraine regardless of Trump.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier stated that the EU alone could provide up to &euro;35 billion, using the bloc&rsquo;s &euro;1.2 trillion seven-year budget as collateral.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly accused the West of <em>&ldquo;stealing&rdquo;</em> its money and warned that tapping into the frozen reserve funds would be illegal and set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Last month, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov promised to initiate retaliatory measures mirroring the West&rsquo;s actions. He said Russia had also frozen the resources of Western investors, financial market participants and companies, adding that <em>&ldquo;the income from these assets will also be used.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The central city of Hama has been surrounded by jihadist forces</strong></p>


            <p>The Syrian army has announced its withdrawal from the central city of Hama after fierce fighting with Islamist militants.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Facebook, the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces said that over the past few days, the nation&rsquo;s troops have <em>&ldquo;fought fierce battles&rdquo;</em> to repel and thwart the <em>&ldquo;violent and successive&rdquo;</em> attacks launched by the jihadists.</p>
<p>However, the intensification of the fighting and the rising death toll have prompted the army to redeploy and reposition its units, the statement read.</p>
<p>The decision was made in order <em>&ldquo;to preserve the lives of civilians&rdquo;</em> and not to involve them in battles, it stressed.</p>
<p>Damascus also said that the militants suffered <em>&ldquo;heavy losses&rdquo;</em> in their ranks during the fight.</p>
<p>The army confirmed that it <em>&ldquo;will continue to carry out its national duty in reclaiming the areas entered by terrorist organizations.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Hama is strategically located in central Syria, about 200km from the capital Damascus; it is also approximately 50km of the city of Homs.</p>
<p>The fighting around Hama has been particularly fierce, according to media reports, since the Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) and its allies launched a large-scale surprise attack in the northwestern part of the country last week.</p>
<p>Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham, which translates as <em>&ldquo;Organization for the Liberation of the Levant&rdquo;</em> and is commonly known as HTS, is considered a terrorist organization by Syria, Russia, Iran, the US, and other countries.</p>

<p>The insurgents have pushed back government forces and captured significant chunks of territory in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Aleppo, which is the second-largest city in the country, had been under Syrian government control since 2016.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s Islamist attack was the first major clash between jihadist and Syrian government forces since March 2020, when Russia and T&uuml;rkiye brokered a ceasefire in the country.</p>
<p>Moscow said on Wednesday that Russia, Iran and T&uuml;rkiye were in <em>&ldquo;close contact&rdquo;</em> over the escalation in Syria.</p>
<p>Moscow intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2015, helping to inflict heavy defeats on numerous terrorist groups, most notably al-Nusra and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Russia maintains a significant military presence in the country and has military bases in Hmeimim and Tartus.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch warned on Wednesday that the fierce fighting in Syria between the government forces and jihadists <em>&ldquo;raises concerns that civilians face a real risk of serious abuses.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Moscow is discussing with Damascus what it needs to beat back jihadist forces, spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said</strong></p>


            <p>The Russian government is analyzing the situation in Syria to determine the level of assistance Damascus needs to deal with an ongoing jihadist offensive, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Militant forces led by the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, last week launched a surprise assault from their base in Idlib, targeting the province of Aleppo. Moscow, which previously helped Damasus quash a jihadist insurgency, has pledged to stand by President Bashar Assad&rsquo;s government during the crisis.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are in constant dialogue with our Syrian friends in Damascus. Depending on the assessment of the situation, the amount of assistance can be decided that the Syrian authorities would need to deal with the militants and eliminate this threat,&rdquo;</em> Peskov told journalists during a regular briefing.</p>
<p>The Russian military previously reported delivering strikes on positions held by HTS and its allies, which it claimed killed hundreds of militants.</p>

<p>The Syrian government thanked Russia this week for providing its special operations forces to help the Syrian Army rescue military recruits from the Assad Military Engineering Academy near Aleppo, which had been besieged by terrorists.</p>
<p>The terrorist offensive in Syria was facilitated by the Ukrainian government, Moscow has claimed. According to media reports, Ukrainian intelligence offices trained Syrian jihadists in drone warfare techniques, based on experience that Kiev&rsquo;s forces have accumulated over the past three years while fighting Russia.</p>
<p>T&uuml;rkiye, which borders militant-controlled Idlib, has objected to military action in the Syrian province. Ankara has argued that hostilities would cause a mass exodus of refugees to flood across the border, which it was not prepared to accept. Instead, a shaky truce was negotiated in 2020.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The treaty outlines measures relating to mutual military assistance and deepened cooperation across various sectors</strong></p>


            <p>The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Russia and North Korea, signed by President Vladimir Putin and his counterpart Kim Jong-un in June, officially came into force on Wednesday following the exchange of ratification documents in Moscow. The treaty, which is <em>&ldquo;indefinite,&rdquo;</em> outlines extensive commitments, including mutual military assistance and deepened cooperation across various sectors.</p>
<p>The agreement obliges both nations to provide military aid if either is attacked, and contains provisions for consultation in the event of a threat of armed aggression. Additionally, both parties commit to not allowing third countries to use their territories to undermine each other&rsquo;s sovereignty or security.</p>
<h3>Key points of the agreement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mutual defense: Immediate military and other assistance will be provided if either country is attacked, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.</li>
<li>Security consultations: Joint measures will be discussed in response to threats of armed aggression.</li>
<li>No third-party agreements: Both nations agree not to allow third countries to use their territories against one another.</li>
<li>Opposition to sanctions: Russia and North Korea will not support unilateral sanctions imposed by third countries on either party.</li>
<li>Strategic goals: Both nations aim to build a multipolar international system and strengthen regional stability.</li>
<li>Economic cooperation: Joint support for special economic zones, as well as food and energy security initiatives.</li>
<li>Science and technology: Expanded collaboration in space exploration, peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology.</li>
<li>Defense mechanisms: Creation of joint initiatives to strengthen military capabilities and prevent war.</li>
</ul>
<p>The treaty replaces a prior agreement signed in 2000, and Russian media report that it underscores both countries&rsquo; commitment to strengthening bilateral ties amid heightened tensions with the West.</p>

<p>The treaty&rsquo;s ratification comes as the West continues to claim that North Korean military personnel are aiding Russia in the Ukraine conflict, though both Moscow and Pyongyang deny any official deployment, and no evidence has been provided to back up the assertions. Meanwhile, South Korea and the US have raised concerns over potential Russian military technology transfers to North Korea.</p>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry has described the agreement as a stabilizing force for northeast Asia, contributing to a <em>&ldquo;just, multipolar world order.&rdquo;</em> However, some Western analysts suggest the pact could alarm China. At the same time, Russian experts largely indicate that Beijing must have given some form of blessing to the arrangement.</p>
<p>The agreement is designed to last indefinitely, with termination requiring one year&rsquo;s notice from either party. It signals a significant shift in Russia-North Korea relations, with both countries seeking closer cooperation in the face of international isolation and sanctions.</p>

                            <p><strong>The treaty of “indefinite” limits includes pledges by the two nations to assist one another in case either faces an armed attack</strong></p>


            <p>The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Russia and North Korea came into force on Wednesday&nbsp;following the exchange of ratification documents in Moscow. The <em>&ldquo;indefinite&rdquo;</em> treaty, signed by President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in June, signals closer cooperation between the two nations amid heightened global tensions.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for mutual military assistance in the event of an attack, pledging immediate support <em>&ldquo;by all means available&rdquo;</em> under Article 51 of the UN Charter. It also outlines commitments to economic, technological, and defense collaboration.</p>
<p>The pact, which replaces a friendship treaty signed in 2000, underscores the intention of Moscow and Pyongyang to resist Western dominance and push for a multipolar global order. It also bans either party from allowing third countries to use their territories in ways that undermine the other&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>The neighboring countries, which share a land border about ten miles long, had ratified the treaty in November. On Wednesday in Moscow, their respective Deputy Foreign Ministers Andrey Rudenko and Kim Jong-gyu signed a protocol that marked its official activation.</p>

<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry described the deal as a <em>&ldquo;stabilizing contribution&rdquo;</em> to the security of Northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, aimed at ensuring regional peace and at <em>&ldquo;building a new, just, multipolar world.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The treaty comes as South Korea and the United States have expressed concern over strengthening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang. Seoul has warned of potential retaliation, including arms supplies to Ukraine, if Russia transfers military technology to North Korea.</p>
<p>The commencement of the agreement also follows claims by Washington and its allies that Pyongyang had sent some 12,000 troops to Russia for training, and for possible deployment in the Ukraine conflict. Moscow and Pyongyang have neither confirmed nor denied the reports. Vladimir Putin had earlier said that it was up to the two nations to decide how they fulfil their mutual commitments under the new treaty.</p>
<p>The pact also strengthens cooperation across key areas, including space exploration, nuclear energy, and defense. Joint initiatives will also target economic zones, food and energy security, as well as advancements in artificial intelligence and biotechnology. It has also created mechanisms to boost military readiness, with the aim of deterring conflicts in the region.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Russian president highlighted economic resilience and global shifts at VTB’s annual event</strong></p>


            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a confident tone during his appearance at the 15th VTB Russia Calling! Investment Forum in Moscow on Wednesday, declaring that Western efforts to undermine the Russian economy had failed.</p>
<p>Addressing business leaders and investors from around the world, Putin praised his country&rsquo;s strong economic performance, criticized Western policies, and championed closer ties with the East and Global South.</p>
<p>The forum, held over two days, focused on &lsquo;The Future of Capital and the Capital of the Future&rsquo;. Putin&rsquo;s speech and subsequent Q&amp;A session covered a wide range of topics, from inflation and cryptocurrencies to Russia&rsquo;s trade relations with Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>Here are the key takeaways from Putin&rsquo;s address:</p>
<h3>East is best</h3>
<p>The president dismissed suggestions that Russia&rsquo;s pivot to the East was a reaction to Western sanctions, asserting that the country&rsquo;s focus on Asia and the Global South had been a strategic decision long in the making.</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p><em>&ldquo;We are naturally guided toward places showing economic growth with a growing number of partners who are not looking over their shoulders to ensure compliance with someone barking orders from the outside,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. He pointed to countries such as Ethiopia and Bangladesh, which have seen GDP growth rates exceeding 100% over the collective past decade, as examples of the dynamic opportunities in these regions.</p>
<p>He criticized what he described as <em>&ldquo;smug attitudes&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;snobbery&rdquo;</em> in the West, claiming they have blinded Western Europe and the US to the changes reshaping the global economy.</p>
<h3>Russia&rsquo;s economic growth massively outperforming Eurozone</h3>
<p>Putin compared Russia&rsquo;s economic success to that of euro currency members, noting that the former&rsquo;s GDP grew by 4.1% in the first ten months of 2024, while the Eurozone is expected to grow by just 1%. He also highlighted the 8.1% growth in Russia&rsquo;s manufacturing sector, particularly in automotive and mechanical engineering.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In Germany, manufacturing is shrinking by 4.6%, but here in Russia, it is growing by 4.4%, with significant achievements in key industries,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. He argued that this indicates that Russia has adapted and thrived despite external pressures.</p>
<h3>Western plot to damage Russian economy has failed</h3>
<p>Putin accused Western nations of attempting to inflict a <em>&ldquo;strategic defeat&rdquo;</em> on Moscow through sanctions and economic pressure, but claimed these efforts had backfired. <em>&ldquo;They sought to destabilize our industries, create shortages, and drive up unemployment,&rdquo;</em> he stated. <em>&ldquo;But instead, Russia&rsquo;s economy has not only recovered but is undergoing qualitative structural changes. This is the most important outcome of the past two or three years.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The president attributed Russia&rsquo;s resilience to a combination of new partnerships, domestic manufacturing, and effective fiscal management, noting: <em>&ldquo;We have achieved record-low unemployment at 2.3%, compared to 7.6% in Italy, 11% in Greece, and even 8% in Brazil.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3>Digital Ruble rollout on track</h3>
<p>Putin highlighted the success of Russia&rsquo;s digital ruble pilot program, which involves over 9,000 citizens and 1,200 companies. He announced that the digital ruble would be integrated into Russia&rsquo;s federal budget system by 2025, with a nationwide rollout planned by mid-year.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Digital currencies reduce transaction costs and increase the security of financial systems,&rdquo;</em> Putin explained, adding that the digital ruble will be part of a broader effort to modernize Russia&rsquo;s financial infrastructure. <em>&ldquo;This is a significant competitive advantage for our economy in the global context,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<h3>Nobody can ban Bitcoin</h3>
<p>Touching on digital currencies, Putin declared that decentralized technologies such as Bitcoin are immune to government bans.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Who can ban Bitcoin? No one,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. <em>&ldquo;The world is evolving toward digital and secure settlement mechanisms, and this is an inevitable process that no sanctions or restrictions can halt.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He also revealed that Russia is working with its BRICS partners to develop a digital investment platform to facilitate secure and inflation-proof financial transactions.</p>
<h3>Corridor to the Indian Ocean</h3>
<p>Putin emphasized the importance of the North-South Corridor, a trade route linking Russia, Iran, and India. He described the project as essential for reducing reliance on Western-controlled trade routes and ensuring economic security.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This corridor will provide seamless movement of goods from St. Petersburg to the Indian Ocean,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. He confirmed that construction of the Rasht-Astara railway in Iran, a critical segment of the route, is progressing, despite technical and logistical challenges. <em>&ldquo;We are determined to complete this project because it opens up tremendous opportunities for trade and minimizes geopolitical risks,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<h3>Most Western firms stayed in Russia</h3>
<p>Despite public claims of mass exits, Putin said that the majority of Western companies have remained operational in Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We never pushed anyone out or banned anyone,&rdquo;</em> the Russian leader insisted. <em>&ldquo;It was their decision to leave, and now many of their niches have been filled by domestic or non-Western brands.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He warned that firms seeking to return may find it difficult to reclaim their market positions, noting the rapid rise of import substitution and new competitors.</p>
<h3>Inflation is a tax on the poor</h3>
<p>Putin described inflation as particularly harmful to low-income citizens, who often lack savings to offset rising prices.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Inflation is a tax on the poor,&rdquo;</em> he stated. <em>&ldquo;We must focus on increasing production and supply to stabilize prices and ease this burden on our most vulnerable citizens.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Putin acknowledged that Russia&rsquo;s inflation rate remains high at 8.8%, but expressed confidence that coordinated efforts between the government and the central bank would bring it under control.</p>
<h3>Africa and Russia close in spirit</h3>
<p>Putin reaffirmed Russia&rsquo;s commitment to stronger ties with Africa, calling the continent a <em>&ldquo;reliable partner&rdquo;</em> and praising its leaders for prioritizing sovereignty and mutual respect.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Nothing has ever divided us from the peoples of Africa,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. <em>&ldquo;Our relations are built on shared values of independence and courage in the face of external pressures.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Arms sales to the island “seriously undermine” China’s sovereignty, the Foreign Ministry has said</strong></p>


            <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on more than a dozen US military firms and senior executives in response to the latest approval of arms sales by Washington to Taiwan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last week, the US State Department authorized an additional $385 million in military sales to Taiwan, following a&nbsp;package of up to&nbsp;$2 billion approved in October, announced a month after a $567 million deal which was signed off in September.</p>

<p>The latest agreement&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;seriously violates&rdquo;</em> the One-China principle, <em>&ldquo;severely interferes in China's internal affairs, and seriously undermines&rdquo;</em> the country&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference.</p>
<p>While the US officially adheres to&nbsp;a One-China policy, recognizing Taiwan as part of China, it simultaneously engages in military cooperation with the government in Taipei.</p>
<p>In response to the latest arms deal, the assets of 13 US defense companies in China will be frozen from Thursday on, and the firms will be prohibited from engaging in trade and cooperation with Chinese entities and individuals, the Foreign Ministry said. The same measures will apply to the six listed senior executives, who will also be denied visas or entry to China.</p>
<p>The ministry urged the US to <em>&ldquo;immediately stop arming Taiwan and stop condoning and supporting&rdquo;</em> the island&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;independence&rdquo;</em> forces.</p>

<p>Self-rule was established in Taiwan by nationalist forces after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Only a handful of nations currently recognize the island&rsquo;s sovereignty, with most of the world, including Russia, complying with Beijing&rsquo;s request that it be seen as part of the People&rsquo;s Republic.</p>
<p>China held large-scale military drills around the island in October. The government in Taipei has claimed that Beijing will never <em>&ldquo;renounce the use of force&rdquo;</em> against it.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry previously highlighted that the ongoing US support to Taiwan contradicts earlier commitments under the August 17 Communiqu&eacute; from 1982, in which Washington pledged not to pursue a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan and expressed its intention to gradually reduce arms sales over time.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Lobito Corridor in Angola demonstrates how the US can fund initiatives to strengthen economies in the region, the White House says</strong></p>


            <p>US President Joe Biden has toured the Angolan port of Lobito on the final day of his three-day trip to the Southern African nation before leaving office next month.</p>
<p>The Atlantic port terminal is part of the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment, a flagship project of Biden&rsquo;s administration that connects Angola to Zambia&rsquo;s Copperbelt Province and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). Washington has invested nearly $4 billion in the 1,300-km railroad and related projects, as it competes for influence with China in a region rich in critical minerals such as cobalt and lithium, required for the manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles as well as clean energy technologies.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Lobito Corridor showcases how the US can deliver financing for investments in infrastructure projects that strengthen economies and advance US and African priorities,&rdquo;</em> the White House said following Biden&rsquo;s tour on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The American leader announced $600 million in additional funding to upgrade the train lines, expand agricultural infrastructure, and construct high-speed mobile networks.</p>
<p>Biden made the commitment at a summit in Lobito, attended by Angolan leader Joao Lourenco, his Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, Zambia&rsquo;s Hakainde Hichilema, and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Isdor Mpango.</p>

<p>Biden&rsquo;s visit to the oil-rich country is the first by a sitting US president to Angola and the first by an American leader to sub-Saharan Africa since 2015. The trip comes just weeks before his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office on January 20.</p>
<p>China dominates mining in the DR Congo and Zambia, and has made significant infrastructure investments in the continent for decades, primarily through the Belt and Road Initiative. During a cooperation summit in September, Beijing <a href="https://www.rt.com/africa/603555-china-africa-summit-beijing-pledges-support/">announced</a> a $50 billion investment in joint projects with its African allies.</p>

<p>The Chinese government additionally signed an agreement with Tanzania and Zambia to restart a decades-old railway project aimed at boosting trade between the two African countries. Analysts believe the project is China&rsquo;s response to the US-funded Lobito Corridor.</p>
<p>The Lobito Atlantic Railway project, awarded to a consortium of Western companies in 2022, has been portrayed as a counter to China&rsquo;s control over resources in Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo&rsquo;s vast reserves of copper and cobalt.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty about the continuation of the Lobito project after Trump&rsquo;s inauguration. However, two officials who served in his previous administration have stated that he will likely support the railway development at least partly when he returns to the White House, as reported by Reuters. Trump also backs measures to counter Beijing and has vowed to impose new tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>
<p>The US president-elect has also warned that BRICS countries will face 100% tariffs on their goods if they establish a new currency or support an existing one as a rival to the dollar. Beijing has said it will continue to expand cooperation with allies despite the threats.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Daily Mail has had to retract a story about troops it claimed were sent to Ukraine “as cannon fodder”</strong></p>


            <p>The Daily Mail has had to retract a story which falsely claimed to provide evidence that female North Korean soldiers&nbsp;are assisting Russia in the Ukraine conflict. The image upon which the report was based turned out to be doctored.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.is/hmPR6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">story</a> originally published by the British tabloid on Wednesday claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had sent women <em>&ldquo;to fight as cannon fodder for [Russian President] Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.&rdquo;</em> The allegation was based on a picture of two women in uniforms, which the newspaper claimed was taken in Zheleznogorsk, a large city in the northwest of Kursk Region. The women were identified as sisters <em>&ldquo;Wei and Lin.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em></em>The fake image is apparently&nbsp;based on a still from&nbsp;a <a href="https://vk.com/video-50332460_456379998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> published last year by a Donetsk-linked channel, featuring twin sisters, who tell a camera operator that they are 25 years old and come from the city of Makeevka. Both claim to have been&nbsp;serving in armed forces since 2014, initially as members of the Donetsk militia.</p>
<p>In a correction, the Daily Mail said later in the day that the fabricated&nbsp;photograph had been provided to it by a <em>&ldquo;trusted freelance reporter&rdquo;</em> and apologized for <em>&ldquo;confusion caused&rdquo;</em> by its erroneous reporting.</p>

<p>Kiev and its Western backers have been claiming for weeks that North Korean troops are helping Russia in Kursk Region.

<p>Ukrainian troops interviewed recently by the BBC have cast doubt on the claims that North Korean troops are present on the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard anything about Koreans, alive or dead,&rdquo;</em> one of the soldiers said, as quoted this week.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to find a Korean in the dark Kursk forest. Especially if he&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo;</em> another one noted sarcastically, paraphrasing an expression from a popular Soviet TV series.</p>]]>

            <p>Russia&rsquo;s Aerospace Forces successfully launched a Soyuz-2.1b rocket on Wednesday, delivering a satellite into orbit. The carrier blasted off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Arkhangelsk Region.</p>
<p>A video of the take-off has been shared by Russia&rsquo;s Defense Ministry. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, the MOD said the launch of the rocket and onboard spacecraft, which will <em>&ldquo;serve the interests of the Russian Ministry of Defense,&rdquo;</em> went smoothly.</p>
<p>The onboard satellite successfully entered its target orbit and is now under the control of Russia&rsquo;s Aerospace Forces, the ministry said.</p>
<p>After being sent into space, the Soyuz-2.1b rocket &ndash; a disposable three-stage medium-lift launch vehicle &ndash; was tracked by the ground-based automated control complex of the German Titov Main Test Space Center.</p>

<p>The previous Soyuz-2.1b launch was conducted last month from Russia&rsquo;s Vostochny Cosmodrome. The rocket delivered two Ionosfera-M heliogeophysical satellites into near-Earth orbit along with 53 small spacecraft; 49 Russian, two Iranian, one Russian-Chinese and one Russian-Zimbabwean device.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Ukrainian leader has called on the US, EU and “everyone in the world” to follow Kiev’s lead</strong></p>


            <p>Ukraine has sanctioned the government of another former Soviet republic, Georgia, which Vladimir Zelensky has accused of <em>&ldquo;surrendering&rdquo;</em> the country to Russia.</p>
<p>Georgia has been gripped by protests since late October, when the pro-Western opposition refused to recognize the results of&nbsp;a parliamentary election in which the ruling Georgian Dream party achieved a convincing victory.</p>
<p>The rallies turned violent last week after the government announced that it would&nbsp;suspend&nbsp;accession talks with the EU, citing&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;constant blackmail and manipulation&rdquo;</em> of Georgian domestic politics by Brussels. There have also been multiple instances of rioters clashing with police in Tbilisi, resulting in several hundred people being detained.</p>
<p>In a video address on Thursday, Zelensky said he had signed a decree to place restrictions on the leader of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili, and 19 other Georgian officials.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These sanctions target the part of the Georgian government that is surrendering Georgia to Putin. This is the very issue that is fueling the protests in Georgia right now,&rdquo;</em> the Ukrainian leader claimed.</p>

<p>He also called on the US, EU and <em>&ldquo;everyone in the world&rdquo;</em> to follow Kiev&rsquo;s example and also slap restrictions on Georgia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We must not lose anyone in this region &ndash; neither Georgia, nor Moldova, nor Ukraine. We must stand united in defending ourselves against Moscow,&rdquo;</em> Zelensky insisted.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested that Zelensky was acting out of <em>&ldquo;anger that Georgia found the strength to reject the Ukrainian scenario.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said a Maidan-style coup, similar to the one that deposed democratically elected Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich in 2014, had <em>&ldquo;failed&rdquo;</em> in Georgia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There was a coordinated and pre-planned effort involving foreign funding for its execution.

<p>The legislation in question was adopted by Tbilisi earlier this year despite heated protests from the opposition, which branded it <em>&ldquo;a Russian law.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said a week ago that he was <em>&ldquo;quite astonished by... bravery and the character&rdquo;</em> with which the Georgian leadership had been defending their stance in the wake of street protests and foreign interference. However, he said the Russian authorities <em>&ldquo;have no relations&hellip; none whatsoever&rdquo;</em> with the government in Tbilisi.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The chancellor has defended last month’s phone conversation with the Russian president</strong></p>


            <p>It would be absurd not to communicate with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. Germany and other EU states would be consigning themselves to irrelevance if they failed to do so, he told lawmakers in&nbsp;Berlin.</p>
<p>Scholz held a phone conversation with Putin in mid-November, which was their first in almost two years. The German head of government urged the Kremlin to withdraw its troops from territories claimed by Ukraine, reiterating his determination to support Kiev for <em>&ldquo;as long as necessary.&rdquo;</em> The Russian president, in turn, attributed the escalation of hostilities in 2022 to NATO&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;long-standing aggressive policy aimed at creating an anti-Russian bridgehead on Ukrainian territory.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to a readout published by the Kremlin, Putin also expressed readiness to engage in talks with Ukraine, stressing, however, that new territorial realities should be taken into account and the <em>&ldquo;root causes of the conflict&rdquo;</em> eliminated.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A session in the German parliament on Wednesday, an opposition MP from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) voiced skepticism over last month&rsquo;s call. Scholz responded by stating: <em>&ldquo;Everybody knows that it would be absurd and a sign of unbelievable political weakness, if we in Germany and in Europe now waited for others to conduct these phone conversations, and we sort of commented on the news shown on TV.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Scholz further insisted that Western European nations must talk to Moscow, despite a difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Previously commenting on the conversation, the German chancellor similarly dismissed criticisms that his outreach could undermine Western unity, arguing that diplomatic channels should remain open and saying that he expected to talk to Putin again.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has criticized the phone call between Scholz and Putin, claiming that it could weaken the Kremlin&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;isolation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Putin said in late November that <em>&ldquo;there was nothing unusual&rdquo;</em> about his call with Scholz, with both officials laying out their positions on the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>The Russian president added that some other Western leaders were <em>&ldquo;willing to resume&rdquo;</em> dialogue, stressing that he remained open to such overtures.</p>
<p>The phone conversation between Scholz and Putin received mixed reactions in the West.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk claimed that <em>&ldquo;no-one will stop Putin with phone calls.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized the importance of maintaining a <em>&ldquo;level of engagement with counterparts who in many cases we disagree with.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Andrey Yermak is telling the president-elect’s inner circle that Kiev won’t stand in the way of peace</strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p>Vladimir Zelensky&rsquo;s right-hand man Andrey Yermak is trying to convince people close to US President-elect Donald Trump that Kiev could endorse his peace plans rather than being an obstacle, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The Republican has claimed that he can resolve the Ukraine conflict in 24 hours after he returns to the Oval Office in January.</p>
<p>Yermak, the chief of staff to the Ukrainian leader, is visiting the US to meet key figures picked by Donald Trump for his future administration, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and multiple news outlets have said.</p>
<p>According to the WSJ, Kiev has arranged contacts with Susie Wiles, the co-chair of Trump&rsquo;s election campaign who has been tapped to become White House chief of staff, Keith Kellogg, who Trump has picked to be a special envoy to Ukraine, and Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser.</p>
<p>Prior to the November presidential election, Zelensky caused a GOP backlash by visiting an arms factory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he was received by Democrats. Republicans have accused the Ukrainian leader of campaigning for their rivals, with House Speaker Mike Johnson demanding that Kiev sack its ambassador to Washington, who organized the trip.</p>

<p>The lobbying attempt by Yermak comes as Ukrainian forces are suffering from battlefield defeats and a shortage of reinforcements. In recent remarks, Zelensky has acknowledged that his country cannot beat Russia militarily and expressed a desire to restore control over all territories Kiev claims through diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>According to CNN, Kiev has ordered the troops which occupy part of Kursk Region in Russia to hold on at all costs until Trump&rsquo;s January 20 inauguration. The operation, which has resulted in almost 38,000 Ukrainian casualties, according to Kremlin estimates, was meant to secure a bargaining chip in future talks. Trump&rsquo;s transition team has reportedly proposed freezing hostilities along the current front line and suspending Ukraine&rsquo;s bid to join NATO for at least a decade.</p>
<p>Moscow has said that no peace negotiations will happen as long as Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk Region. NATO&rsquo;s intention to welcome Ukraine was a key cause of the conflict, Russian officials have maintained.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Russian president has praised African nations’ development potential and defense of their sovereignty</strong></p>


            <p>Africa holds a special place for Russia, rooted in shared values of sovereignty and self-determination, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the plenary session of the VTB Investment Forum &lsquo;Russia Calling!&rsquo;, Putin emphasized the connection between Russia and African nations.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Africa may seem geographically distant, but it is a continent close to us in spirit,&rdquo;</em> the Russian leader said, noting that African nations <em>&ldquo;cherish their sovereignty&rdquo;</em> and make decisions that serve the interests of their people.</p>
<p>Putin highlighted Africa&rsquo;s immense potential, saying that view is shared globally, even by Western experts.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The African continent has very good development prospects... Many of my friends from Germany and other countries say that they too want and plan to increase their activities on the African continent,&rdquo;</em> he remarked.</p>
<p>The president announced the establishment of a fund aimed at fostering cooperation between Russia and Africa. <em>&ldquo;We will create new tools... to develop our cooperation with African countries. I am confident that, both bilaterally and in our work with various African organizations, we will increase our efforts,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>

<p>Putin acknowledged, however, that the current trade level between Russia and Africa &ndash; around $25 billion &ndash; is not high enough. He stressed the need to expand economic ties, citing the commitment shown by African leaders at previous high-level summits.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;We are united, particularly by the promising development of the African continent. Of course, we will do everything to increase this level,&rdquo;</em> Putin stressed.</p>
<p>Speaking at the inaugural ministerial conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum in November, held in the Sirius Federal Territory near Sochi, Vladimir Putin reaffirmed Moscow&rsquo;s commitment to supporting African nations in key areas, including combating terrorism, epidemic diseases, and food insecurity. He emphasized Russia&rsquo;s dedication to sustainable development and addressing natural disasters across the continent.</p>

                            <p><strong>Market players betting “wildly” on the technology are risking a correction, Vanguard’s chief economist has said</strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p>Investor enthusiasm for AI equities in the US stock market has overestimated the near-term potential of the technology, risking a <em>&ldquo;correction&rdquo;</em> in share prices, American asset management giant Vanguard has warned, according to the Financial Times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-related stocks have become key drivers behind the rise of the US stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 index soaring by 27% this year. About one fifth of the increase comes from the contribution of Nvidia, a core chip supplier for AI, which saw its stock price rocket by nearly 180% year to date in 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Vanguard chief economist Joe Davis, however, believes investors are overplaying the short-term impact of the technology, even if AI shows similar <em>&ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;</em> effects to the emergence of the personal computer in the 1980s, the outlet wrote on Tuesday. He claimed that in the US technology and communication services sectors, share prices are <em>&ldquo;inexplicably high&rdquo;</em> relative to expected rates of corporate profit growth.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We see roughly 60% to 65% odds that AI is more impactful than the personal computer. The US stock market today is pricing roughly a 90% probability,&rdquo;</em> said Davis. &nbsp;</p>

<p>He compared the current economic situation to that of the 1990s, when a PC boom led to a massive surge in equities prices, resulting in the telecom-driven meltdown in 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;From an economic perspective we&rsquo;re roughly in the year 1992 but from the market valuation perspective, I can make the argument that we&rsquo;re in 1997,&rdquo;</em> he added, implying that there could be a bubble risk in the current market. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Davis, who leads the world&rsquo;s second-largest asset management group, investors <em>&ldquo;grow euphoric early on&rdquo;</em> then suffer disappointment when the new technology&rsquo;s potential is not quickly realized. Although AI could bring transformative effects in the coming years, earnings growth expectations for the next three to five years are <em>&ldquo;wildly&rdquo;</em> optimistic, he said.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis also warned that companies most closely related to the AI investment boom may not become the ultimate profit-makers. The real beneficiaries are entities that actually apply the technology such as hospitals, utilities, and financial companies, he argued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The former Al-Qaeda Syrian militants would clean up the streets and engage with minorities, a pro-Israeli researcher has claimed</strong></p>


            <p>Syrian jihadist forces that recently led the surprise assault on the city of Aleppo could be better than the current regime at governing people and protecting minorities, a piece published in The Telegraph has argued.</p>
<p>The column reports on the PR campaign by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Idlib-based terrorist group formerly known as Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, and its current leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. Last week, it conducted a military offensive against Syrian government forces and, together with allied militant groups, managed to overrun Aleppo.</p>
<p>The author, Aaron Zelin, is a research fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a pro-Israeli think tank. He argued that, despite the origins and authoritarian nature of HTS, it could prove to be <em>&ldquo;ready to govern as well as fight.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Jolani, who has a $10 million US bounty on his head, has made a number of remarks to <em>&ldquo;make sure that no one harasses or harms the Christian or Kurdish community&rdquo;</em> in Idlib, Zelin said. One of his statements used the phrase <em>&ldquo;diversity is a strength&rdquo;</em> &ndash; a phrase <em>&ldquo;more redolent of Western HR departments than jihadist warlords,&rdquo;</em> the researcher claimed. HTS has called Aleppo <em>&ldquo;a meeting place of civilization with cultural and religious diversity for all Syrian,&rdquo;</em> the article said.</p>

<p>While Zelin acknowledged that the messaging may be just a PR campaign, he said the terrorist group&rsquo;s opposition to the government of President Bashar Assad make it appealing to some people in the West. But other officials cited the maxim that the <em>&ldquo;enemy of my enemy can still be my enemy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Syria was plunged into a protracted war in 2011, as various anti-government groups sought to topple the Assad government. Jihadist forces, particularly those employing foreign fighters and receiving military assistance from abroad, emerged as dominant players among the opposition. Meanwhile, the US and other Western nations, which demanded that <em>&ldquo;Assad must go,&rdquo;</em> claimed that <em>&ldquo;moderate rebels&rdquo;</em> could ultimately prevail in the conflict.</p>
<p>Russia intervened in the hostilities in 2015, lending its airpower to Damascus. The Syrian government restored control over most of the country, but some places, including Idlib province near the Turkish border, remain outside of its reach.</p>

<p>The country&rsquo;s pro-Western political parties are staging nightly protests in the post-Soviet republic, which have escalated into clashes with the police on multiple occasions, in an attempt to overturn the results of the October elections, which they claim were rigged.</p>
<p>Blinken accused Tbilisi&rsquo;s ruling Georgian Dream party of committing <em>&ldquo;brutal and unjustified violence&rdquo;</em> against protesters while announcing the possibility of new punitive measures on Wednesday, and expressed support for what he called the desire of the people to join <em>&ldquo;the Euro-Atlantic family.&rdquo;</em> Washington&rsquo;s commitment to that is <em>&ldquo;ironclad,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>Blinken demanded the release of detained protesters and that officials be held accountable for police officers <em>&ldquo;engaging in the unlawful use of force.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>On multiple occasions, rally-goers have reportedly fired fireworks at riot police and pelted them with rocks. The officers used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds. Dozens of people on both sides have been reported injured since mid-November.</p>

<p>Georgia&rsquo;s President Salome Zourabichvili is among the leaders of the protest movement. She has said that she will not step down from office when her term expires later this month, because, she claims, the newly-elected parliament cannot legally pick her successor.</p>
<p>On Monday, the French-born head of state urged schools to support the protesters. This triggered a <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/608696-georgia-patriarchate-schools-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuke</a> from the influential Georgian Orthodox Church, which interpreted her call as an attempt to drag minors into the conflict.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party has compared the events in the country with Ukraine&rsquo;s 2014 <em>&ldquo;Euromaidan&rdquo;</em> protests, a Western-backed campaign that escalated into a successful armed coup. Last week, the national government announced that it was suspending integration with the EU, after accusing Brussels of using Tbilisi&rsquo;s bid for political leverage.</p>
<p>Mamuka Mdinaradze, a senior Georgian Dream official, has <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/608730-georgia-protests-many-foreigners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that as many as 30% of the people participating in the protests are foreign nationals.</p>]]>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>South Africa’s presidency is expected to change the group’s vision of the world economy</strong></p>


            <p>As South Africa assumes the presidency of the G20 in December 2024, it carries the hopes of Africa and the Global South for a more equitable world order. This pivotal moment comes amid growing discontent over neo-colonial economic systems, wars of profit, and unchecked exploitation of natural resources by the Global North. South Africa&rsquo;s leadership must challenge these systemic injustices and forge a path toward unity, sustainability, and justice for the Global South.</p>
<h2><strong>The stakes: Neocolonialism and exploitation</strong></h2>
<p>For decades, the Global South has been the lifeblood of global capitalism, supplying essential<strong> </strong>resources like cobalt, lithium, and crude oil, yet reaping minimal benefits. Studies reveal that<strong> </strong>African nations lose an estimated $88.6 billion <a href="https://unctad.org/es/isar/news/africa-could-gain-89-billion-annually-curbing-illicit-financial-flows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annually</a> to illicit financial flows, often tied to<strong> </strong>resource extraction by multinational corporations based in the West.<strong></strong></p>
<p>This systemic plunder mirrors colonial patterns and deprives nations of funds needed for<strong> </strong>development and poverty alleviation.<strong> </strong>South Africa, as a BRICS member, must use the G20 platform to protect natural resources from<strong> </strong>exploitation. Proposals could include mechanisms for transparent resource governance, fair<strong> </strong>pricing for exports, and sanctions against corporations engaging in exploitative practices.<strong> </strong>Failure to act risks perpetuating the cycle of dependency and underdevelopment.<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Wars of profit and Western hegemony</strong></h2>
<p>Wars waged for profit and geopolitical dominance have devastated many nations in the Global South, from Iraq and Libya to Yemen and beyond. These conflicts have often been justified under the guise of promoting democracy or combating terrorism but are deeply tied to securing resources and maintaining Western hegemony.</p>

<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has spoken out against such interventions, emphasizing the importance of multilateralism and respect for sovereignty. South Africa&rsquo;s G20 presidency should prioritize conflict resolution through dialogue, oppose militarization, and demand accountability for nations that perpetuate wars under false pretenses. As Ramaphosa noted, peace rooted in international law is critical to achieving sustainable development.</p>
<h2><strong>BRICS as a force for unity</strong></h2>
<p>The BRICS bloc &ndash; comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, as well as new members Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates &ndash; offers a blueprint<strong> </strong>for economic and political cooperation among emerging economies. By prioritizing infrastructure<strong> </strong>development, trade, and technology sharing, BRICS has already demonstrated its potential to<strong> </strong>challenge Western dominance in global governance.<strong></strong></p>
<p>South Africa should align its G20 agenda with BRICS priorities, emphasizing collective<strong> </strong>bargaining for the Global South. The bloc&rsquo;s New Development Bank, for instance, could be<strong> </strong>positioned as an alternative to Western-led financial institutions, providing loans without the<strong> </strong>onerous conditions that perpetuate dependency.<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>The importance of inclusivity: Russia&rsquo;s exclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The exclusion of Russia from the G20 threatens the forum&rsquo;s credibility as a platform for global cooperation. Without all major economies at the table, efforts to reform global systems will lack legitimacy. Russia, a key energy supplier and member of BRICS, plays an essential role in shaping a multipolar world order.</p>
<p>South Africa must advocate for an inclusive G20, warning against double standards that alienate members and weaken the group&rsquo;s collective resolve. An equitable reworking of the global economic system requires that no voices &ndash; especially those representing significant portions of the Global South &ndash; be silenced.</p>
<h2><strong>Charting a bold African agenda</strong></h2>
<p>South Africa has the opportunity to push for transformative reforms that address the systemic challenges facing the Global South. Protecting the continent&rsquo;s natural resources from exploitative practices should be at the forefront. South Africa can lead efforts to establish global frameworks for equitable resource management, emphasizing transparency, ethical extraction, and value addition within Africa. Such an approach would ensure that the continent&rsquo;s wealth benefits its people rather than being syphoned off to foreign powers.</p>
<p>Addressing the wars of profit and geopolitical domination that devastate many Global South nations is equally critical. These conflicts, often tied to resource competition and perpetuated by foreign interference, require global mechanisms that prioritize peacebuilding over militarization.</p>
<p>South Africa can use its G20 presidency to advocate for a renewed international commitment to non-aggression, mediation, and respect for sovereignty, reinforcing global peace as a prerequisite for sustainable development.</p>
<p>The reform of international financial institutions is another urgent priority. South Africa must champion debt justice, advocating for fair lending terms, interest-free loans, and debt cancellation for struggling nations. It must also push for the democratization of financial governance, ensuring that Global South nations have a real voice in decisions that shape their economic futures.</p>

<p>The BRICS partnership provides an inspiring model of economic cooperation and resilience. By aligning G20 goals with the priorities of BRICS, South Africa can promote intra-Global South trade, technology sharing, and investment in critical infrastructure. Moreover, African nations bear the brunt of climate change but receive a fraction of the necessary adaptation funds. South Africa&rsquo;s leadership can amplify demands for wealthy nations to fulfil their commitments, ensuring that climate financing is equitable and accessible.</p>
<p>This agenda is ambitious but necessary. It represents a roadmap for dismantling systemic inequalities and building a fairer global economy. South Africa must seize this moment to lead boldly and decisively.</p>
<h2><strong>Radical alternatives: Reimagining Global South economic independence</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;As South Africa takes on the G20 presidency, it must also consider the potential of radical alternatives to the current global economic platforms. These alternatives prioritize self-reliance, regional integration, and the establishment of fair and equitable economic models that challenge the dominance of neo-colonial systems.</p>
<p>An African common market, anchored by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), offers a powerful starting point. By enhancing intra-African trade, standardizing regulations, and fostering regional supply chains, such a market can reduce dependence on external economies. It could also catalyze industrialization and ensure that more value is retained within the continent, addressing the historical imbalance in trade relations.</p>
<p>Equally transformative would be the creation of an African Organization for Natural Resources. This body could oversee the ethical extraction and equitable management of Africa&rsquo;s vast natural wealth, from minerals to agricultural resources. By enforcing fair pricing mechanisms and ensuring revenues are reinvested in local communities, such an organization could dismantle exploitative systems that have long drained Africa of its riches.</p>
<p>The vision of a gold-backed African currency also holds immense promise. A unified currency backed by Africa&rsquo;s abundant gold reserves could reduce dependence on foreign currencies like the US dollar, shielding African economies from external shocks. It would also symbolize economic sovereignty and provide a foundation for stable, independent trade relations.</p>
<p>Finally, a Global South movement for fair trade and sovereign economic models could unite nations in rejecting exploitative export systems and promoting localized, sustainable development. By emphasizing self-sufficiency, value addition, and equitable trade terms, this movement could build economic systems that prioritize the needs of the people over the profits of multinational corporations.</p>

<p>While ambitious, these alternatives which were first mapped out in the late 1990s by Libya&rsquo;s then-leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, offer a roadmap to true economic liberation for the Global South, aligning with South Africa&rsquo;s call for solidarity, equality, and sustainability.</p>
<h2><strong>Navigating resistance</strong></h2>
<p>Challenging the status quo will invite opposition from wealthier G20 members. However, South Africa can counterbalance this by rallying support from fellow BRICS members, the African Union, and other Global South nations. This coalition could serve as a counterweight to Western dominance, pushing for reforms rooted in equity and justice.</p>
<p>South Africa&rsquo;s G20 presidency is an opportunity to reshape global systems that perpetuate inequality, conflict, and exploitation. By leveraging its position as a BRICS member and a leader in the African Union, South Africa can champion a bold vision for the Global South.</p>
<p>The stakes are high, but the moment demands courage. If South Africa can disrupt the status quo and assert a transformative agenda, it will leave a legacy of justice and empowerment for generations to come. This presidency is not just about managing an agenda &ndash; it is about rewriting the rules of global governance. And we, the citizens of the Global South, are watching.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Bloc officials are privately considering diplomatic ways to wind down Kiev’s conflict with Russia, according to the outlet</strong></p>


            <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s Western backers are shifting from attempting to push for a military victory against Russia towards trying to help Kiev achieve the best position to negotiate a ceasefire, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The report comes as Russian forces advance in Donbass at a rate unseen since 2022, while recapturing ground from Ukrainian forces entrenched in Russia&rsquo;s Kursk Region.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin <em>&ldquo;has shown no willingness to discuss a ceasefire,&rdquo;</em> and with US President-elect Donald Trump less than two months away from taking office, Kiev&rsquo;s NATO allies are attempting to steel themselves <em>&ldquo;as morale starts to fade,&rdquo;</em> Bloomberg wrote.</p>
<p>While Trump&rsquo;s plan for Ukraine is unclear, he was elected on promises of curtailing American spending on the conflict and focusing on internal US issues.</p>
<p>Gathering in Brussels this week, foreign ministers from NATO nations discussed how to supply Kiev with more weapons, anonymous sources told Bloomberg, noting that any plans are still private and incomplete. They have also reportedly begun to look at different ways to end the conflict, including discussing which security guarantees could protect Ukraine without antagonizing Putin.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Those discussions come amid recognition that the situation in Ukraine is unsustainable and negotiations should begin soon,&rdquo;</em> Bloomberg reported, citing a senior Western diplomat.</p>
<p>One idea floated was to create a demilitarized zone, with European troops responsible for its security, the outlet cited a senior NATO diplomat as saying.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if the US maintains course on future military aid, contrary to Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign rhetoric, mounting losses will force Ukraine into talks by next year, Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, told Bloomberg.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Ukraine lacks the manpower to stop the Russian offensive, and the West has little left to give in terms of existing stocks of weapons,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky previously insisted that Kiev is not interested in joining NATO if it excludes Russian territories that were part of Ukraine before 2014.</p>
<p>However, Zelensky told Kyodo News on Monday that Kiev could agree to a ceasefire with Moscow without these territories if NATO membership is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s aim of joining the US-led military bloc has been underscored by Putin as one of the core reasons for the conflict. Russia&rsquo;s terms are that Ukraine adopt a neutral, non-bloc status, remain free of nuclear weapons, demilitarize and undergo denazification, the Russian leader has said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Yerevan has passed the point of no return in its relations with the Collective Security Treaty Organization, Nikol Pashinyan has said</strong></p>


            <p>Armenia will not participate in the affairs of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and essentially considers itself out of the alliance, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has said.</p>
<p>The CSTO, established in 1992 following the break-up of the USSR, comprises several former Soviet republics, with Armenia as one of its founding members.</p>
<p>Under Pashinyan&rsquo;s leadership, Armenia has distanced itself from the CSTO, having frozen its participation earlier this year.</p>
<p>The prime minister emphasized that differing perspectives between Armenia and Russia regarding the alliance are making it <em>&ldquo;increasingly difficult, if not impossible&rdquo;</em> for Armenia to consider returning to the CSTO.</p>
<p>In a parliamentary address, Pashinyan referred to territorial conflicts with Azerbaijan in 2021 and 2022.</p>
<p>He noted that when he sought support from CSTO allies during these episodes, their responses indicated confusion about Armenia&rsquo;s borders.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We told our allies that &lsquo;red lines&rsquo; have been crossed, a</em><em>fter which they replied that it seems that the border is not delimited...&nbsp;</em><em>If the organization does not know where Armenia's borders are, then the CSTO does not exist,&rdquo;</em> Pashinyan said.</p>

<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with tensions centered on the disputed Karabakh region, which until recently was predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians. Most recently, in 2023 the two post-Soviet republics reignited a feud over the territory. Baku then took control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, causing the remaining Armenians to flee.</p>
<p>In November, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that as Yerevan never recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as its own territory, the CSTO could not consider Azerbaijan&rsquo;s actions as aggression against an alliance member. <em>&ldquo;Therefore, claims that the CSTO should have fought on the territory of the enclave sound somewhat odd,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>The Russian leader also noted that Armenia has still not formally withdrawn from the alliance, adding that Yerevan&rsquo;s change in course regarding the CSTO is most likely caused by internal political processes.</p>

<p>In June, Armenia and the US announced their intention to build relations into a <em>&ldquo;strategic partnership.&rdquo;</em> The next day Pashinyan said that Armenia would pull out of the CSTO.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, James O&rsquo;Brien, the US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, welcomed Armenia&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;brave steps&rdquo;</em> to wind down its relationship with Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Much of the population of Armenia wants to get further from Russia, so we are creating the conditions for that to happen,&rdquo;</em> the official said.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Russian president has hailed New Delhi’s focus on economic policies that prioritize national interests</strong></p>


            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised efforts by Indian&nbsp;Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to foster&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;stable conditions&rdquo;</em> for economic development through policies that prioritize national interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking at the VTB Investment Forum in Moscow on Wednesday, Putin drew parallels between Russia&rsquo;s import substitution program and a similar initiative in India, and expressed Russia&rsquo;s willingness to expand investments in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Prime Minister Modi has a similar program called Make in India. We are also prepared to set up a manufacturing base in India... The Indian prime minister and government have been creating stable conditions because the leadership is committed to an &lsquo;India first&rsquo; policy, and we believe that investments in India are profitable,&rdquo;</em> Putin stated.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I know that under Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s leadership, a similar policy is being implemented in India. Everyone is well aware of his call: &lsquo;Make in India.&rsquo; We, for our part, are also ready to establish certain production facilities in India,&rdquo;</em> Putin continued.</p>
<p>He reminded attendees that the single largest investment in the Indian economy to date &ndash; amounting to $20 billion &ndash; was made by Russia&rsquo;s state-owned oil giant Rosneft in 2017 when it acquired Essar Oil (now known as Nayara Energy).&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">❗️Putin Hails PM Modi&#39;s &#39;Make In India&#39; <br><br>The India-first policy has created &quot;stable conditions&quot; in the country, and Russia is ready to place manufacturing sites in the country, the President said. <a href="https://t.co/Yxc34z9fIy">pic.twitter.com/Yxc34z9fIy</a></p>&mdash; RT_India (@RT_India_news) <a href="https://twitter.com/RT_India_news/status/1864321083484078401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p><em>&ldquo;The fact that the prime minister of India and the government are creating such reliable and stable conditions is largely due to the Indian leadership&rsquo;s nationally focused policy across all areas, including the economy,&rdquo;</em> Putin noted. <em>&ldquo;We consider investments in India to be stable and highly profitable.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Economic cooperation between the two countries has expanded in recent years, amid&nbsp;Western sanctions against Moscow. New Delhi has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian oil despite Western pressure, taking bilateral trade beyond $65 billion last year.</p>
<p>As the world&rsquo;s third-largest consumer of oil, India relies on imports for over 85% of its needs. Russia has become India&rsquo;s top supplier, and New Delhi often highlights Moscow&rsquo;s role in ensuring energy security. Officials have argued that India&rsquo;s purchases of Russian oil and coal have helped stabilize the global energy market, preventing a widespread energy crisis.</p>
<p>During their meeting in Moscow in July, Russian and Indian leaders set a bilateral trade target of $100 billion. While welcoming the constant growth in economic cooperation, the sides acknowledged that a significant trade imbalance, driven by India&rsquo;s rapid increase in oil imports, should be addressed. While imports from Russia last year stood at $61.1 billion, Indian exports were just $4.2 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putin is <a href="https://www.rt.com/india/608564-preparations-putin-india-visit-kremlin/">expected to visit India</a> next year at the invitation of Modi, the Kremlin confirmed on Monday. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said the exact date will be finalized in early 2025.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The head of state, Yoon Suk Yeol, also faces impeachment after parliament blocked his attempt to impose martial law</strong></p>


            <p>South Korean police have launched a probe targeting President Yoon Suk Yeol, after he briefly imposed martial law, a senior officer has announced.</p>
<p>The head of the National Police Agency&rsquo;s investigation headquarters, Woo Jong-soo, told South Korean lawmakers that <em>&ldquo;the case has been assigned&rdquo;</em> against Yoon, AFP news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to Woo, the president is suspected of <em>&ldquo;insurrection.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The crisis in South Korea erupted on Tuesday when Yoon delivered a surprise televised address declaring emergency martial law, on the grounds that the opposition &ndash; which he accused of being sympathetic towards the North &ndash; had been preparing a <em>&ldquo;rebellion.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Within hours, 190 lawmakers, who managed to access the National Assembly despite military cordons, voted unanimously to lift the decree. Thousands of people took to the streets to condemn the president&rsquo;s actions.</p>

<p>Early on Wednesday, Yoon said he had decided to lift martial law, less than six hours after imposing it. Later that day, the opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, announced that it would file a motion to impeach the head of state.</p>
<p>Yoon&rsquo;s People Power Party (PPP) has said it will block the attempt to impeach the president.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;All 108 lawmakers of the People Power party will stay united to reject the president&rsquo;s impeachment,&rdquo;</em> the party&rsquo;s floor leader, Choo Kyung-ho, told a live-streamed party meeting.</p>
<p>The head of PPP, Han Dong-hoon, told reporters that by resisting the impeachment, his party is <em>&ldquo;not trying to defend the president&rsquo;s unconstitutional martial law.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>According to Yonhap news agency, the opposition plans to hold an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday, and needs the backing of just eight PPP members to succeed.</p>

                            <p><strong>Aleksey Poroshenko has reportedly flouted mobilization law and ignored multiple conscription notices</strong></p>


            <p>The eldest son of former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko, Aleksey Poroshenko, is being sought by law enforcement for dodging the military draft, several Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday, citing sources in the armed forces.</p>
<p>The news comes amid an increasingly violent <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/608368-ukrainian-draftees-cornered-rats-officer/">mobilization drive</a> in Ukraine, as Russian forces advance in Donbass and Ukrainian troops suffer severe losses.</p>
<p>According to the news outlets Ukrainian Law and Business and Strana.ua, Aleksey Poroshenko ignored two notices to report to a conscription office back in October. His failure to respond to the summons is in violation of Ukrainian laws at a time of mobilization. The ex-president&rsquo;s son is a reserve officer, Strana.ua noted.</p>

<p>Aleksey Poroshenko, his wife, daughter and son live in London and Singapore, according to Ukrainian media. From those two cities, Poroshenko remotely manages a business in Ukraine, which his father signed over to him, according to media reports.</p>
<p>The former president&rsquo;s son reportedly took part in Ukraine&rsquo;s so-called <em>&ldquo;anti-terrorist operation&rdquo;</em> aimed at subduing Donetsk and Lugansk in 2014. However, in the two months the younger Poroshenko served, he was guarded by 20 members of the Ukrainian special forces and did not participate in combat, Strana.ua wrote.</p>
<p>His father is currently a suspect in a years-long high treason case, over alleged secret coal deals with representatives of the Donetsk and Lugansk People&rsquo;s Republics during his time in office.</p>

<p>Pyotr Poroshenko is a Ukrainian lawmaker and leader of European Solidarity party, a small opposition faction in parliament.</p>
<p>He was elected president in 2014, months after the US-backed coup in Kiev, which triggered the conflict in Donbass.</p>
<p>Two months into his tenure, he authorized the Ukrainian army to attack the Donbass city of Donetsk, resulting in an&nbsp;episode known as the Ilovaysk <em>&ldquo;cauldron&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&ndash; in which Donetsk self-defense forces encircled the Ukrainian troops and destroyed them. The affair prompted Kiev&rsquo;s Western backers to sue for the first Minsk Agreement, which they later acknowledged was only intended to buy time and arm Kiev against Moscow.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Warsaw has categorized WWII massacres by OUN and UPA as genocide</strong></p>


            <p>Several Polish lawmakers want to criminalize the propaganda of the ideology that drove Ukrainian nationalists, citing the genocidal massacres of ethnic Poles by Stepan Bandera&rsquo;s followers during WWII.</p>
<p>Between 1943 and 1945, Bandera&rsquo;s Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) murdered at least 60,000 ethnic Poles in the regions of Volynia and Eastern Galicia. Some estimates put the death toll as high as 120,000, and the Polish government considers the massacre a genocide.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, two members of the Polish parliament proposed adding UPA and Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) ideology to the list of proscribed beliefs, which currently includes fascism, national-socialism and communism.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Polish politicians want to condemn the ideology of the struggle for Ukraine&rsquo;s independence,&rdquo;</em> Ukrainian lawmaker Vladimir Vyatrovich posted on Facebook on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He added that the same struggle is <em>&ldquo;going on right now,&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;its result will decide the fate of not just Ukraine but Poland as well,&rdquo;</em> referring to Kiev&rsquo;s conflict with Moscow.</p>

<p>According to the document quoted by Vyatrovich, two members of the Law and Justice Party (PiS) want to amend the Law on the Institute of National Memory. To the existing ban on public propaganda of Nazism and other <em>&ldquo;totalitarian regimes,&rdquo;</em> the amendment would add <em>&ldquo;the ideology of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, the Bandera faction (OUN-B) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which led to the genocide in Volyn and neighboring areas in 1943-1945.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Vyatrovich used to run Ukraine&rsquo;s Institute for National Memory and was banned from entering Poland in 2017 over his defense of OUN and UPA. He was later elected to the parliament on the ticket of European Solidarity, the party of former president Pyotr Poroshenko.</p>
<p>Last week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga and his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski signed a joint statement in Warsaw clearing the way to exhume some of the mass graves of the Volyn massacre victims. Poland has made Ukraine&rsquo;s recognition of the Volyn <em>&ldquo;genocide&rdquo;</em> a condition of supporting Kiev&rsquo;s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko declared Bandera and the UPA <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/558154-ukrainian-envoy-nazi-collaborator-hero/&nbsp;">national heroes</a> in 2010. This was reaffirmed by the government installed by the US-backed coup in 2014. Since then, Ukrainian nationalists have held torchlight parades every January to mark Bandera&rsquo;s birthday, calling him the <em>&ldquo;father of the nation.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The pro-western opposition just lost a key election, but its leaders won’t accept the results</strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p>Since November 28, large-scale protests have rocked Georgia following the government&rsquo;s decision to freeze negotiations for the country&rsquo;s EU accession until 2028. Despite attempts by police to block off Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi, the strife has continued with demonstrators erecting barricades, lighting fires, and shooting fireworks at law enforcement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has insisted that Georgia will not allow itself to be <em>&ldquo;Ukrainized,&rdquo;</em> as his Western-backed opponents encouraged a mass mobilization.</p>
<p>The political fallout has been enormous. Outgoing President Salome Zourabichvili, who hails from France, rejected the legitimacy of the new parliament, insisting she would remain in office despite the fact that elections are scheduled for December. In response, the ruling Georgian Dream party, which comfortably won the parliamentary elections, announced that new presidential elections would proceed as planned.</p>
<p>The protests are not just about internal politics&mdash;they also signal a broader geopolitical struggle, with Georgia at the crossroads of the Russian-Western rivalry.</p>

<p><strong>Election Results and Protests</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks after the Georgian Dream party&rsquo;s victory in the October elections, Kobakhidze announced a freeze on EU accession negotiations until 2028, fueling protests across the country. Critics immediately accused the ruling party, which they label as <em>&ldquo;pro-Russian,&rdquo;</em> of undermining Georgia&rsquo;s European future. This accusation has been leveled against the government, even though many of the opposition parties, funded by Western NGOs, have long pushed for Georgia to fall in line with Western powers.</p>

<p>Both President Zourabichvili and former President Mikhail Saakashvili, staunch pro-Western figures, quickly led the charge against the election results, calling them fraudulent and part of a <em>&ldquo;Russian special operation.&rdquo;</em> Zourabichvili stated, <em>&ldquo;Recognizing these elections is the same as accepting Russia&rsquo;s entry here and Georgia&rsquo;s subordination to Russia.&rdquo;</em> Such rhetoric has been repeated by others in the opposition, who insist that Georgia&rsquo;s future is tied to Western Europe, not Russia.</p>
<p>Despite the claims of fraud, the international community did not back up the opposition&rsquo;s accusations. Western governments have called for investigations into alleged electoral violations but have stopped short of formally rejecting the results. In fact, the European Parliament &ndash; which is relatively toothless &ndash; was the only entity to refuse to recognize the elections, even calling for sanctions on Georgia&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Azerbaijan, Armenia, Hungary, T&uuml;rkiye, and China&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/MFA_China/status/1851210316098744747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">congratulated</a> the ruling party&nbsp;on their victory. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that Russia does not interfere in its neighbor&rsquo;s internal affairs and urged others similarly. <em>&ldquo;[This is ] the choice of the Georgian people&nbsp; &ndash; it&rsquo;s crucial that no third parties interfere in the results of this election,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Overall, according to OSCE observers, the voting process went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/georgia/579376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smoothly,</a> with media reports indicating only a few major incidents. However,&nbsp;following the outcry from the election losers, the Central Election Commission decided to recount the ballots from five precincts in each electoral district for data verification. The recount&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dw.com/ru/perescet-golosov-na-vyborah-v-gruzii-podtverdil-dannye-cik/a-70648114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> the initial results.</p>
<p>But this did not stop the opposition.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Protests and Violent Clashes</strong></p>
<p>The protests reached a new intensity over the week.&nbsp;Some 20,000 demonstrators gathered in Tbilisi on the evening of the announcement, and the rallies have spread to other cities, including Poti, Rustavi, Telavi, and Kutaisi.</p>
<p>Despite Kobakhidze&rsquo;s firm stance against &lsquo;Ukrainization,&rsquo; the opposition remains steadfast, demanding new elections with international supervision. <em>&ldquo;The only negotiations we will hold with the government will be about conducting new elections with the assistance of international observers,&rdquo;</em> said opposition MP Giorgi Vashadze.</p>
<p>However, under Georgian law, a repeat election can only be called if the original vote is invalidated or if no party receives at least 5% of the votes. The opposition&rsquo;s call for new elections is therefore unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>The opposition has little means to influence the government,&nbsp;due to a lack of power and administrative resources, Dr Stanislav Pritchin, head of the Central Asia sector at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has told RT.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Firstly, the opposition does not hold a majority in parliament and can only block initiatives that require a constitutional majority. Therefore, they have very limited ability to influence government decisions. Secondly, regarding public influence, the protests have proven ineffective. The opposition lacks supporters, energy, and substantial backing from the West,&rdquo;</em> Pritchin claimed.</p>
<p>Even with active support from the EU and US, the opposition would still struggle to alter the situation in the country or influence public sentiment, Pritchin believes, since the October election results are convincing and have been recognized by international observers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The Future of Georgia&rsquo;s Geopolitical Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Kobakhidze has repeatedly emphasized that Georgia&rsquo;s future lies in Euro-Atlantic integration, but recent statements suggest that the country&rsquo;s path is far more complicated. He has voiced the hope that it will be ready for EU membership by 2030, but his government also sees strategic partnerships with Russia and China as important parts of Georgia&rsquo;s future. <em>&ldquo;We have very important foreign policy priorities, and the main one is of course, Euro-Atlantic integration,&rdquo;</em> he said, although this is tempered with a desire for improved relations with Russia.</p>
<p>The conflict between Georgia&rsquo;s domestic political forces and the West over EU membership is exacerbated by the pressure from Western powers, particularly the EU and the US, to align more closely with them against Moscow. While Georgia has made moves to engage with Russia diplomatically, tensions remain high over Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia aims to reintegrate. They are recognized as independent states by Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, the opposition, backed by Western powers, wants Georgia to lean decisively toward the EU and NATO, even at the risk of souring relations with Moscow. With a fragmented electorate and deeply polarized political factions, the current protests are unlikely to end without a significant political shift&mdash;either through reform or a potential collapse of the Georgian Dream government.</p>
<p>On November 30, the US suspended its strategic partnership with Georgia, citing <em>&ldquo;anti-democratic&rdquo;</em> actions by the ruling party. The State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/statement-on-georgias-suspension-of-european-union-accession/?fbclid=IwY2xjawG4R_xleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHXCg6aRwLDunMYBiFwTZb3WQdhFE7q47hJMmIJDvbNO3P2pleVTB9RLS8g_aem_eneoyhMpqtVtC9e9rXYpvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>&nbsp;that by halting the EU accession process, Georgian Dream&nbsp;has made the country more vulnerable to Russia.</p>
<p>The following day, on December 1, the new EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, the former Prime Minister of Estonia,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/european-union/article/2024/12/01/eu-s-new-foreign-policy-chief-warns-georgia-over-violence-against-protestors_6734768_156.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indicated</a> that the EU might impose sanctions on Georgia due to the harsh crackdown on protests..</p>
<p>Follwing&nbsp;the escalation&nbsp;of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, the Georgian authorities asserted that a <em>&ldquo;global war party&rdquo;</em> wanted to open a <em>&ldquo;second front&rdquo;</em> against Russia in Georgia. Former Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili claimed this was the goal of the opposition and its <em>&ldquo;ideological allies from the Ukrainian government&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>As the election campaign progressed, this rhetoric intensified. Officials didn&rsquo;t mention the EU or US, although a few days before the elections, former Georgian PM Bidzina Ivanishvili&nbsp;<a href="https://www.interpressnews.ge/ka/article/817192-bizina-ivanishvili-irakli-garibashviltan-erti-kveqnis-magali-tanamdebobis-piri-aseti-tipis-saubars-acarmoebda-3-milioni-xart-da-3-4-dgeshi-qvelas-ver-amogxocaven-shegizliat-partizanuli-mozraobit-tqeshi-gaxvidet-chven-dagexmarebit-da-ikidan-iometo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that a senior official from <em>&ldquo;one of the countries&rdquo;</em> had suggested to Garibashvili that he should start a war against Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Improving relations with Russia&mdash;strained since the 2008 war over Abkhazia and South Ossetia&mdash;became a key theme of the election campaign.<em>&nbsp;</em>Kobakhidze identified the normalization of bilateral relations as a key priority for the coming years, while Ivanishvili expressed confidence that Georgia would <em>&ldquo;find the strength to apologize&rdquo;</em> to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, territories it lost following the 2008 conflict begun by the UMP's Saakashvili. Georgia&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to reintegrate the unrecognized republics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the elections, the moderately pro-Russian rhetoric in Georgia gave way to a colder tone. Kobakhidze&nbsp;<a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2024/10/27/premier-gruzii-raskryl-plany-na-dipotnosheniya-s-rossiey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that the country doesn&rsquo;t plan to restore diplomatic relations with Russia, citing that <em>&ldquo;10% of our territory is occupied&rdquo;</em>. <em>&ldquo;We have very important foreign policy priorities, and the main one is of course, Euro-Atlantic integration,&rdquo;</em> he said, noting that relations with the EU will be reset in <em>&ldquo;intensive mode&rdquo;</em> starting in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ivanishvili, one of Georgia's richest men,&nbsp;<a href="https://civil.ge/ru/archives/629590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elaborated</a> on the matter and said that ties with the West would improve once the conflict in Ukraine concludes, which he believes could happen soon. However, until then, Georgia will staunchly defend its interests and avoid confrontation with Russia, even at the potential cost of its relationship with the EU.</p>
<p>Stanislav Pritchin&nbsp;told RT that Georgian authorities will pursue a balanced approach in international relations. They will strive to build pragmatic ties with Russia while keeping the door open for negotiations with Western nations.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Russia-Georgia relations are likely to proceed along the same lines as they do now. Indeed, there may be attempts to deepen bilateral ties and establish more regular political contacts. But for now, Georgia isn&rsquo;t ready to resume diplomatic relations or fully cooperate in economics and other fields.

<p>It is unlikely that Western countries consider a change in the situation in Georgia as a realistic scenario from the outside. Georgian Dream&nbsp;has not backed down on any fundamental issues, has confidently won the elections and continues to maintain its position even under threat of being removed from the list of EU candidate countries and likely mass protests.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>A Country at a Crossroads</strong></p>
<p>Georgia&rsquo;s future remains uncertain, caught between the competing interests of Russia and the West. The ongoing protests reflect a deep division within the country: one side sees Georgia&rsquo;s path tied to Russia, while the other pushes for integration with the EU. The ruling Georgian Dream party may have won the elections, but the opposition, though lacking significant public support, is fighting to keep Georgia on the path of its backers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This political crisis has become a critical juncture in the country's&nbsp;history. The ultimate direction Georgia takes will not only determine the future of its sovereignty but also shape its role in the broader geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West. Will Tbilisi&nbsp;fully embrace a Western&nbsp;future, or will it forge a path of pragmatism that acknowledges Moscow&rsquo;s influence? The outcome remains uncertain, and the consequences will resonate far beyond Georgia.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>It would be “inappropriate” to speculate on the idea before the hostilities end, the German Chancellor has said</strong></p>


            <p>Deployment of German troops to Ukraine is <em>&ldquo;out of the question&rdquo;</em> and it would be <em>&ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;</em> to speculate about the proposition without peace talks starting, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.</p>
<p>Scholz made the remarks on Wednesday while addressing the German parliament about remarks made earlier this week by the country&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock.</p>
<p>Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO&rsquo;s top diplomats on Tuesday, Baerbock signaled that Berlin was open to the idea of sending a peacekeeping force into Ukraine.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The German side will support everything that serves peace in the future,&rdquo;</em> she said, adding that the country&rsquo;s soldiers <em>&ldquo;could be deployed only under the condition of a real ceasefire.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remarks prompted widespread speculation on how exactly such a deployment could flesh out, yet Scholz cautioned against drawing any conclusions from Baerbock&rsquo;s statement, insisting she had worded it in extremely vague terms on purpose.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;She was asked what could happen in a peace phase, and actually she tried to answer this without saying yes or no. Because it&rsquo;s quite inappropriate to speculate now about what would happen later in the event of a negotiated cease-fire,&rdquo;</em> Scholz told the parliament.</p>
<p>The chancellor ruled out any possibility of sending troops to Ukraine before a lasting ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev was established.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We are in agreement with the minister of defense and the foreign minister that we must do everything to ensure that this war does not become a war between Russia and NATO. And that is why sending ground troops is out of the question for me in this war situation,&rdquo;</em> he explained.</p>
<p>The mixed messages from German leadership come amid a string of media reports that suggested France and the UK have been considering deploying their troops to the front line in Ukraine as a peacekeeping force to observe a ceasefire in the event of Russia and Ukraine actually engaging in negotiations.</p>
<p>An unnamed high-ranking NATO official, who spoke to state-funded news outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, suggested the true goal of the potential deployment was ensuring that European NATO members still have a say in the conflict&rsquo;s resolution after US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Intelligence Service has reported that Western nations are considering sending as many as 100,000 <em>&ldquo;so-called peacekeepers&rdquo;</em> to Ukraine. That sizable force would effectively amount to an occupation and would only serve the purpose of buying time for Kiev to rebuild its military strength before renewing hostilities with Moscow, it warned.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Jared Isaacman has led two private spaceflights through SpaceX, in 2021 and 2024</strong></p>


            <p>US President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Jared Isaacman, the billionaire CEO of payments company Shift4, who has led two private spaceflights and has conducted a spacewalk, to be the next head of NASA.</p>
<p>Isaacman, 41, is a close associate of billionaire Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX. He is now in line to replace the current administrator, Bill Nelson, who was nominated by outgoing president Joe Biden in 2021 and who has also traveled into orbit, as part of a Space Shuttle mission in 1986.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Jared will drive NASA&rsquo;s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration,&rdquo;</em> Trump wrote on Wednesday in a post on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Isaacman said he was honored to receive the nomination and looked forward to helping <em>&ldquo;usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,&rdquo;</em> he wrote on X, adding that <em>&ldquo;Americans will walk on the Moon and Mars and, in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p></p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am honored to receive President Trump’s <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realDonaldTrump</a> nomination to serve as the next Administrator of NASA.

<p>In a letter to Shift4 employees, Isaacman wrote he intends <em>&ldquo;to remain CEO until my confirmation&rdquo;</em> and to <em>&ldquo;retain the majority of my equity interest,&rdquo;</em> but will reduce his shareholder voting power.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;After nearly 26 years leading Shift4, the time has come for me to embark on a new journey,&rdquo; </em>the entrepreneur wrote.</p>
<p>In 2021, Isaacman led the first all-civilian mission to space on a chartered flight with SpaceX.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, he led the Polaris Dawn mission as SpaceX&rsquo;s crew of civilian astronauts conducted the first commercial spacewalk. The mission was meant to test new technologies and procedures that could be used in future space flights. The spacewalk lasted roughly two hours and was broadcast live.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Back at home we all have a lot of work to do but, from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world,&rdquo;</em> Isaacman said during the spacewalk after emerging from the capsule.</p>
<p>NASA has ties to SpaceX, relying on the company&rsquo;s rocket launches to take astronauts into space and bring supplies to the International Space Station. If confirmed as NASA administrator, Isaacman would oversee multibillion-dollar contracts that the US government has awarded to SpaceX.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The UK is not prepared for Ukraine-level casualty rates, Alistair Carns has said</strong></p>


            <p>In case of an actual conflict, the UK would run out of soldiers in six months to a year, the British Ministry of Defence official in charge of personnel, Alistair Carns, has said.</p>
<p>Carns is the under-secretary of State for veterans and people in the country&rsquo;s defense ministry. He raised concerns about the size of the British Army during an event at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In a war of scale &ndash; not a limited intervention, but one similar to Ukraine &mdash; our army, for example, on the current casualty rates would be expended &mdash; as part of a broader multinational coalition &mdash; in six months to a year,&rdquo; </em>Carns said.</p>
<p>He based this calculation on questionable Ukrainian claims that Russia was taking 1,500 casualties every day, which Moscow has described as closer to Kiev&rsquo;s actual losses.</p>
<p>While this doesn&rsquo;t mean the UK needs a bigger army, <em>&ldquo;it does mean you need to generate depth and mass rapidly in the event of a crisis,&rdquo;</em> he added. <em>&ldquo;The reserves are critical, absolutely central, to that process.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Publicly available information has put the size of the British Army at 109,245 people as of October 1, which includes 25,814 volunteer reservists. Carns argued that the UK has a lot of catching up to do with other NATO members when it came to reserves.</p>

<p>His comments come just days after Britain&rsquo;s Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Rob Magowan insisted that the army would <em>&ldquo;fight tonight&rdquo;</em> if ordered.</p>
<p>In late October, however, British secretary of defense John Healey told Politico that the army, navy and the air force had been <em>&ldquo;hollowed out&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;underfunded&rdquo;</em> during the 14 years of Conservative Party rule. Labour had expected things to be bad, <em>&ldquo;but the state of the finances, the state of the forces, was far worse than we thought,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The UK, in keeping with many other nations, has essentially become very skilled and ready to conduct military operations. What we have not been ready to do is to fight,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/606406-uk-military-nato-healey/">Healey said</a></em>&nbsp;at the time.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty claimed, citing anonymous sources, that the UK and France were discussing deploying their <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/608614-western-troops-ukraine-trump/">troops to Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>As of July, the British Army had just over 73,000 active-duty soldiers, the lowest number since 1823. The UK&rsquo;s overall population was around 20 million then, and has since grown to 67 million.</p>
<p>The British Army was established in 1707 and is part of the UK&rsquo;s armed forces along with the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force (RAF). It is not called <em>&ldquo;royal&rdquo;</em> because a standing army is based on the parliamentary forces that fought a civil war against the crown in the 1600s.</p>

                            <p><strong>Only a quarter of foreign companies exited the country under US and EU pressure, according to the president</strong></p>


            <p>Russia has never pressured foreign companies to leave the country amid Western sanctions and the vast majority have stayed, President Vladimir Putin stated on Wednesday at the Russia Calling! forum in Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin noted that despite political pressure from their governments, many companies from the US and Western Europe continue to operate in Russia.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We never pressured anyone to leave our market,&rdquo;</em> Putin said. <em>&ldquo;Half of those firms continue to operate in the country as they did before [sanctions]. Some have transferred operations to local management under their control, and only about a quarter [of such firms] have left or are in the process of leaving the country&rsquo;s economy,&rdquo;</em> he added.</p>
<p>According to the president, breaking with Russia has played a major role in the economic problems that the EU countries are currently facing. In particular, this is due to the loss of stable Russian energy supplies at reasonable prices, as well as the opportunity to sell their products and supply components to the Russian market, and to use logistics routes, he explained.</p>
<p>The EU also lost the opportunity to use its currency for settlements, which significantly cuts into profits in the bloc&rsquo;s economy, Putin added.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;In particular, large companies [in the EU] are closing... others are suffering losses. Glass, chemical, fertilizer production, and agriculture are suffering serious losses because... they have lost the Russian market,&rdquo;</em> he pointed out.</p>
<p>Putin emphasized that Germany&rsquo;s economy in particular has suffered the biggest blow due to sanctions imposed on Russia. <em>&ldquo;Entire enterprises are closing&rdquo;</em> due to the loss of Russian energy and raw materials, affecting the country&rsquo;s most important sector of the economy &ndash; the automobile industry, according to the Russian president.</p>
<p>Putin said many Western countries have shown themselves as <em>&ldquo;unreliable partners,&rdquo;</em> pointing out that many businesses and entire industries in Russia faced serious challenges due to sanctions and the exit of foreign firms.</p>
<p>Despite this, <em>&ldquo;our doors are always open,&rdquo;</em> the president told attendees at the forum.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Kiev has to make “hard decisions” like getting younger people to the conflict’s front lines, the top US diplomat has told Reuters</strong></p>


            <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Ukraine needs to begin conscripting men as young as 18 to succeed on the battlefield against Russia. The current minimum age set by Kiev for draftees is 25.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington and its allies have long been pushing Ukraine to lower its mobilization age to replace its losses of personnel on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Blinken made the remarks on Wednesday in an interview with Reuters at NATO headquarters in Brussels, after attending a two-day meeting of the military bloc&rsquo;s foreign ministers.</p>
<p>The top US diplomat said that Kiev has <em>&ldquo;hard decisions&rdquo;</em> to make about further mobilization.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Getting younger people into the fight, we think, many of us think, is necessary,&rdquo;</em> Blinken stated. <em>&ldquo;Right now, 18- to 25-year-olds are not in the fight,&rdquo;</em> he said, noting it is up to Kiev to decide how best to get them into frontline operations.</p>
<p>He reiterated the call at a press meeting on Wednesday, claiming that manpower is critical, <em>&ldquo;because even with the money, even with the munitions, there have to be people on the front lines.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The secretary of state also said that NATO is committed to making sure that every soldier that Ukraine mobilizes has <em>&ldquo;the training and the equipment they need to effectively defend the country.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte echoed Blinken&rsquo;s view, telling reporters on Wednesday <em>&ldquo;we need probably more people to move to the front line.&rdquo;</em> He did not mention a particular age group, though.</p>

<p>The West&rsquo;s calls for Kiev to lower its conscription age come as the country&rsquo;s military faces high desertion rates and a shortage of fighting-age men at the front.</p>
<p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/608510-ukraine-desertion-losses-troops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Saturday that the Ukrainian military is plagued with high desertion rates, with at least 60,000 of its soldiers having gone AWOL.</p>
<p>Last week, Dmitry Litvin, an aide to Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, said that the US call to replenish the country&rsquo;s fighting forces with young men <em>&ldquo;does not make sense&rdquo;</em> and that Washington should instead focus on sending the firepower it has promised Kiev as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has long argued that Kiev&rsquo;s Western backers are willing to use Ukrainian men as <em>&ldquo;cannon fodder&rdquo;</em> in what Moscow regards as a US proxy war against Russia and will urge the country to fight <em>&ldquo;to the last Ukrainian.&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Michel Barnier is the first prime minister since 1962 to lose a no-confidence vote</strong></p>


            <p>French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has lost a no-confidence vote in parliament, as lawmakers on both the left and the right united to oust him.</p>
<p>A no-confidence motion requires 288 votes in the National Assembly. Wednesday evening&rsquo;s motion received 331 votes, with the left-wing New Popular Front (NPF) and the right-wing National Rally (RN) uniting in opposition to the minority cabinet imposed by President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider it a victory,&rdquo;</em> RN&rsquo;s Marine Le Pen told TF1 after the vote. <em>&ldquo;We made the choice we made to protect the French people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It was not done lightly,&rdquo;</em> Le Pen added. <em>&ldquo;There was no other solution.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of NPF&rsquo;s largest party, said that the outcome was <em>&ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;</em> and called for Macron&rsquo;s resignation.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Even with a Barnier every three months, Macron will not last three years,&rdquo;</em> he said on X. The French president has ruled out resigning, however.</p>
<p>Macron appointed Barnier in September, drawing the ire of NPF. The left-wing coalition had won the most seats in the parliament in this summer&rsquo;s snap elections, as part of a pact with the president to sideline RN. But Macron then turned around and snubbed NPF in favor of a minority cabinet that relied on the tacit support of RN.</p>
<p>Things came to a head over the social security budget proposal, in which Barnier tried to cut spending by &euro;40 billion ($41.87 billion) and to raise &euro;20 billion in taxes to deal with a massive deficit. RN threatened a no-confidence vote unless the cabinet made a number of concessions to its <em>&ldquo;red lines.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Le Pen accused the prime minister of being <em>&ldquo;extremely closed-minded and sectarian&rdquo;</em> in the budget talks and gave Barnier a deadline to meet RN&rsquo;s demands, which Budget Minister Laurent Saint-Martin rejected.</p>
<p>There have been almost 150 no-confidence motions since the Fifth Republic was established in 1958. Prior to Wednesday, only one government had ever been ousted &ndash; Georges Pompidou&rsquo;s, in October 1962.</p>

<p>Barnier is likely to stay on as a caretaker PM until Macron can appoint a replacement. It took the French president nearly two months to do so after July&rsquo;s parliamentary election. Another vote is not an option, because the French constitution forbids it until at least a year has passed.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Russian military has released a new video showcasing the destruction of a military vehicle at the front</strong></p>


            <p>The Russian Defense Ministry has released a new video reportedly showing the destruction of a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier (APC) by a bomber drone.</p>
<p>The thermal video, reportedly taken by the bomber drone itself, was captured at the Vremevka Ledge, a string of villages in the west of Donetsk People&rsquo;s Republic. The area saw active combat during the ultimately disastrous Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. In recent weeks, it has seen a new uptick in fighting, with the Russian military advancing at multiple locations.</p>
<p>The video shows the Ukrainian armored personnel carrier, apparently an old Vietnam War-era US-made M113 or a similar vehicle, poorly concealed in shrubbery. It had apparently sustained a hit offscreen, likely by an FPV kamikaze drone, before the bomber UAV finished it off. The APC is missing its engine cover, its anti-drone netting is torn, and its supports are visibly bent.</p>

<p>The bomber drops what appears to be a hand grenade right into the half-open top hatch of the APC, prompting the troops inside to attempt to evacuate.</p>

<p>The munition, however, goes off, causing a massive blast and fire inside the APC, likely triggering extra ammo kept inside. The footage ends with a flyover of the destroyed vehicle, with the corpses of its occupants visible from the opened rear ramp.</p>
<p>Bomber drones have been actively used by both sides of the conflict, with such UAVs deployed to strike stationary or abandoned vehicles, fixed positions, groups of soldiers, and so on. The bomber drones commonly carry a handful of small munitions, such as hand grenades, modified ammo for automatic grenade launchers, or homemade explosive devices. Heavier models can carry mortar and land mines, engineering munitions and other heavier explosives.</p>]]>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                            <p><strong>The short-lived period of martial law was the result of a complex internal power struggle and will likely lead to the president’s downfall</strong></p>


            <p>The political crisis that culminated in South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol&rsquo;s short-lived attempt to establish martial law, which was lifted just five and a half hours after he declared it, did not come out of the blue. While the opposition has been quick to spread its own narrative, there is no doubt that the situation is more complex and requires closer analysis.</p>
<h2>The situation in context</h2>
<p>The issue goes back to the 2022 South Korea presidential elections. At that time, Yoon Suk Yeol &ndash; a former prosecutor general who, following a conflict with then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in had switched to the conservative camp (despite the fact that earlier, Yoon had prosecuted two conservative presidents) &ndash; and won the presidential elections by 0.73%, an unprecedentedly thin margin in Korean history.</p>
<p>From the start, Yoon faced a challenge, since the opposition, the Democratic Party, held a qualified majority slightly more than half but less than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>This power dynamic allowed South&nbsp;Korea&rsquo;s Democratic Party to block presidential initiatives while pushing their own agendas, which in turn were often vetoed by the president. This situation largely paralyzed legislative activity and fueled the polarization of society.</p>
<p>The parliamentary elections in April 2024 did little to change things. While these elections have been called a significant defeat for the ruling party, the conservatives actually garnered slightly more votes than four years earlier (108 versus 103). The Democratic Party failed to secure a two-thirds majority, but it still held a qualified majority, which allows to pass or block legislation without regard for political opponents. At that point, it became clear that the crisis that had paralyzed the national legislature would persist for the remainder of Yoon&rsquo;s term.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the government initiated criminal proceedings against the controversial opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, who had largely turned the Democratic Party into his personal fan club. There are substantial grounds for the allegations against him, and setting aside the political polarization of society, he would have likely been imprisoned anyway &ndash; even considering the fact that five key witnesses in various cases either died or committed suicide before they could testify. In one case, he received a suspended sentence, while another case resulted in acquittal (which was deemed a legal miracle). However, he still faces four additional verdicts.</p>

<p>Given that even a suspended sentence approved by the Supreme Court would end Lee&rsquo;s political career, the situation swiftly evolved into a race of <em>&ldquo;who will bury whom first&rdquo;</em>: either the government would convict the leaders of the Democratic Party, or the latter would successfully initiate impeachment proceedings against the president.</p>
<p>Tensions within the ruling party, exacerbated by a campaign called <em>&ldquo;People for Impeachment&rdquo;</em> and backed by associated NGOs (including labor unions, university professors, and Catholic clergy), theoretically gave the opposition a chance to amass 200 votes &ndash; enough to proceed with impeachment regardless of the underlying reason. However, most of the accusations leveled against the president by opponents are as groundless as his own claims about anti-state or pro-North Korean forces, which he used to justify the imposed martial law.</p>
<h2>Attempted coup and its possible causes</h2>
<p>The events that unfolded during the <em>&ldquo;five hours of martial law&rdquo;</em> evoke memories of the military coups led by former South Korean presidents Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan, and the saying, <em>&ldquo;History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>At 11pm local time on December 3, following a closed-door meeting allegedly initiated by the Minister of National Defense, President Yoon addressed the nation, and for the first time since 1979, <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241203012155315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imposed</a><em> &ldquo;martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Yoon accused the opposition of paralyzing the government with anti-state activities. <em>&ldquo;The National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, paralyzing the judicial and administrative systems and attempting to overthrow the free democratic system through legislative dictatorship,&rdquo;</em> he said.</p>
<p>Following Yoon&rsquo;s address, General Park An-soo, the martial law commander, <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241204001100320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> a decree banning all political activity, including protests and parties. Military vehicles entered the city; however, despite the blockade of the parliament building, lawmakers, backed by the crowd, managed to get inside. 190 MPs then unanimously voted to rescind martial law in accordance with the country&rsquo;s constitution. Military forces began to withdraw, and shortly thereafter, the president made another address to the nation. He said that he wanted to safeguard the country, but since the parliament had opposed his decision, martial law will be lifted.</p>
<p>To say that this story has left me astounded is an understatement. I had earlier considered the possibility of a <em>&ldquo;top-down coup</em>,<em>&rdquo;</em> but ultimately, it seemed quite unlikely. In my opinion, which was <a href="https://journal-neo.su/ru/2024/10/03/k-sluham-o-podgotovke-voennogo-polozheniya-v-yuzhnoj-koree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressed </a>in a recent article for the internet journal New Eastern Outlook, <em>&ldquo;President Yoon, despite his rigid stance, recognizes that he has neither a reason nor an opportunity to impose martial law &hellip; Tanks in the streets would spark mass protests, and the army is not prepared to fire at civilians. Ultimately, we could witness a scenario reminiscent of the 1991 Soviet coup attempt, when the opposition consolidated against the president which led to a number of casualties and [eventually resulted in] the complete defeat of the coup plotters.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Adding to the intrigue, it became clear that neither the Prime Minister of South Korea nor the leader of the ruling party were informed of the president&rsquo;s decision. The latter was among the first to label the move as incorrect and voted against it in parliament. News of the martial law even reached Washington. US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said that the US was <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20241204002651315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watching</a>&nbsp;the developments with <em>&ldquo;grave concern&rdquo;</em> and reminded Seoul that democracy underpins the US-South Korea alliance, and any political disputes should be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.</p>
<p>South Korean society did not consider the situation critical, given the fact that the Democratic Party has been talking about the impending dictatorship and urging people to take to the streets since their leader was threatened with imprisonment. As a result, Yoon&rsquo;s actions backfired on him and were even condemned even by the leaders of the ruling party. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that today, the South Korean military is not the same as it was during the dictatorship &ndash; it is not ready to fire at civilians. In this context, it&rsquo;s reassuring that the president opted against escalation that could have resulted in bloodshed.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Yoon Suk-Yeol&rsquo;s actions also puzzled Pyongyang. Instead of airing a full morning news broadcast, North Korean state media mostly broadcast music. Meanwhile, North Korean newspapers reported that yet another <em>&ldquo;progressive organization&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;had called for impeachment without, however, mentioning the recent events. As of the time of writing, the North Korean Central News Agency has still not commented on the matter.</p>
<p>What could have prompted the president to make such a seemingly misguided move? As I noted in a previous article, Yoon is pragmatic enough to understand the risks that would come with&nbsp;failure, so it is crucial to understand his motive. There are several theories at this point.</p>
<p>According to one, Yoon simply lost his nerve. Another theory suggests that either Yoon or his advisors (reportedly the martial law idea was suggested by Minister of National Defense Kim Yong-hyun, the former head of the presidential security service and Yoon&rsquo;s former schoolmate) thought they could get ahead of the situation but misjudged the capabilities and effectiveness of South Korean security forces. A third theory proposes that the decision was made spontaneously under some external pressure, forcing the president to go all-in.</p>

<p>A similar idea implies that misinformation from Yoon&rsquo;s adversaries might have manipulated him into making a move that would lead to his downfall. It&rsquo;s worth noting that President Yoon is not a seasoned politician. The former prosecutor general, who transitioned into politics just a year before becoming president, may lack a deep understanding of how bureaucracy operates, particularly since the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in South Korea is a militarized structure with strict internal discipline. We may draw parallels to the Park Geun-hye era, when a close circle of advisors manipulated the leader through biased information.</p>
<p>Curiously, some conspiracy theorists believe that the US might have played a role in this affair. Despite Yoon&rsquo;s pro-American stance, he has not altered his policy regarding Ukraine, and a delegation led by Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov left South Korea empty-handed. Amid the growing ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, there were grounds to suspect that the &ldquo;red line&rdquo; between Seoul and Moscow could soon be crossed and South Korea would send military aid to Kiev, but this did not happen. Therefore, we may not exclude the possibility that the outgoing Biden administration may have provided Yoon with some &ldquo;trustworthy intelligence,&rdquo; compelling him to risk everything.</p>
<p>So what comes next? A failure like this, which alienated nearly everyone from the president, is equal to political suicide. The more Yoon clings to power, the lower his already dwindling approval ratings will fall; he will be held accountable for all past mistakes, and it will be very hard to get his point across. The opposition has already demanded Yoon&rsquo;s immediate resignation, since an attempt to enact martial law without due justification is considered an act of rebellion. On December 4, opposition parties in the National Assembly filed a motion to introduce an impeachment bill against Yoon. Given&nbsp;that many conservative MPs supported the opposition in this decision, they are likely to secure the 200+ votes required to impeach the president.</p>
<p>Moreover, the South Korean government and presidential administration have also announced their resignations. Among those stepping down are Chief of Staff Chung Jin-suk, National Security Bureau Director Shin Won-sik, Chief of Policy Sung Tae-yoon, and other high-ranking officials.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the major political parties? While impeachment may slow down the judicial process against the opposition leader, societal polarization remains high. As a result, the Democratic Party is working to pass retroactive legislation that could shorten statutes of limitations on certain offenses, potentially allowing cases to be dropped. As for the conservative party, it has taken a firm stance and distanced itself from the president, so the conservatives might have a fair shot in the upcoming presidential elections, especially if the court acts lawfully and Lee is imprisoned.</p>
<p>How does all this affect global instability and Russia&rsquo;s interests? First off, it&rsquo;s important not to conflate different events. The situations in Georgia, Abkhazia, Syria, and South Korea are unrelated. This situation has been a long-standing issue for South Korea, and it could have unfolded a month earlier or later, depending on domestic political triggers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A more pressing question for Russia is whether the new government will be better or worse than the old one when it comes to Russia&rsquo;s interests. On the one hand, due to party politics, the Democratic Party might undo the former president&rsquo;s initiatives, including his pivot toward closer ties with the US and Japan. On the other hand, under President Yoon, South Korea maintained its status as <em>&ldquo;the friendliest of unfriendly nations&rdquo;</em> regarding Russia, whereas Democrats tend to lean towards populist solutions and have a pro-European agenda that could push them towards supporting Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both the conservatives and democrats in South Korea are heavily influenced by the US. The rhetoric of the Democratic Party about strategic autonomy from the US merely reflects internal party struggles: when Conservatives emphasize a strong alliance with the US, Democrats must counter that narrative. This means that to secure some maneuverability on sensitive issues, concessions must be made elsewhere. President Yoon was fully aligned with Washington on the issue of North Korea but retained flexibility regarding Russia and China. In contrast, democrats prioritize North Korea, which may lead them to &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; Russia and China.</p>
<p>Overall, the situation surrounding the declaration of martial law is quite complex, and it would be simplistic to believe the narrative that the president wanted to establish a dictatorship but was thwarted by the people. All we can say is that South Korea&rsquo;s political life will be quite eventful in the near future, so stay tuned.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Justice Department has reportedly endorsed a taxpayer-funded procedure for inmate who sent explosives to their Washington address</strong></p>


            <p>The US Department of Justice has reportedly endorsed a taxpayer-funded <em>&ldquo;gender reassignment&rdquo;</em> surgery for a prison inmate charged with sending a mail bomb to the DOJ headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p>The prisoner, who was initially not identified in court documents, sued for a sex-change last December. The Georgia Department of Corrections sent a status report to the court on Monday, revealing that the surgery will be performed soon.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Gender Dysphoria Committee convened on November 1, 2024. The Committee has medically cleared Ms. [Jane] Doe for surgery and has informed the Georgia Department of Corrections that the recommended treatment plan for Ms. Doe is gender reassignment surgery,&rdquo;</em> says the document, quoted by the conservative outlet Headline USA on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane Doe&rsquo; is the legal pseudonym for parties that wish to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Headline USA has identified the plaintiff as David Cassady, 55, who has been serving a life sentence in a Georgia state prison since 1993 for multiple counts of <em>&ldquo;aggravated sodomy,&rdquo;</em> gang membership, and other charges.</p>
<p>In April this year, the DOJ charged Cassady with making two bombs and mailing them to a federal courthouse in Alaska and <em>&ldquo;a federal facility at 1400 New York Avenue NW in Washington, DC.&rdquo;</em> The latter is the DOJ headquarters in the US capital.</p>

<p>Cassady allegedly made the bombs in 2019-2020, while serving his sentence at the Reidsville, Georgia prison, which has since closed. He was then transferred to the Phillips State Prison in Buford.</p>
<p>The federal indictment charged Cassady with one count of making an unregistered destructive device, two counts of mailing a destructive device, and one count of attempted malicious use of an explosive. The defendant has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>After the charges were unsealed in April, Atlanta&rsquo;s WSB-TV revealed that one of the bombs was sent to the widow of the man Cassady sexually assaulted as a teenager.</p>
<p>The federal trial was scheduled for December 9 but was recently postponed, with no new date scheduled. According to Headline USA, the DOJ has continued to refer to Cassady as a man in the bomb case, but as a woman in the amicus brief supporting his request for a sex change at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.</p>
<p>Cassady&rsquo;s case appears to be based on the precedent set by Peter <em>&ldquo;Donna&rdquo;</em> Langan, a neo-Nazi bank robber who last year became the first federal inmate to receive gender-reassignment surgery at government expense.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Derrick Bales is to stand trial for committing a terrorist act in Russia’s Kursk Region, according to the Investigative Committee</strong></p>


            <p>A Russian court has&nbsp;issued an arrest warrant for&nbsp;US citizen Derrick Bales, who is accused of mercenarism and of carrying out a terrorist act in Kursk during Ukraine&rsquo;s incursion into the region in August, the Investigative Committee in Moscow announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bales is a former US infantryman and the owner of the Forward Observations Group, which refers to itself as a military-style brand that sells tactical gear and accessories but which Russia maintains is a private military company.</p>
<p>The group has posted photos of Bales and other Americans fighting in Kursk and Donbass on its Instagram page.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the committee announced it had completed a criminal investigation into Bales during which it obtained witness testimonies and examined documents as well as internet resources.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Irrefutable evidence was collected in the criminal case, which fully confirmed the guilt of the defendant,&rdquo;</em> the body said in a statement, adding that it has formally charged Bales &ndash;in absentia&ndash; of <em>&ldquo;mercenarism and of committing a terrorist act in Kursk Region in late August 2024.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>At the request of investigators, a court made the decision to arrest Bales in absentia and to place him on the international wanted list, the Investigative Committee said.</p>
<p>The criminal case against Bales was originally opened by Russian investigators in October, when he was accused of mercenarism, of allegedly committing a terrorist act, of murder and of the attempted murder of two or more persons, of illegally crossing Russia&rsquo;s state border and of using force against government representatives, among a litany of other alleged crimes.</p>
<p>According to investigators, Bales has been directly participating in the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a mercenary, acting as part of the Forward Observation Group PMC and fighting on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Bales and other representatives of mercenary formations, acting with representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and armed with automatic small arms and large-caliber firearms, using explosive devices, as well as military equipment, illegally crossed the state border of the Russian Federation at the end of August 2024 and invaded the territory of the Kursk region,&rdquo;</em> Russian investigators said.</p>
<p>In late October, the Committee also opened a criminal case in absentia against another American, Robert Werthman, who was accused of mercenarism and of other crimes while taking part in Ukraine&rsquo;s incursion into Kursk Region.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has cited a report that Kiev’s intel may be working with terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham</strong></p>


            <p>A significant <em>&ldquo;Ukrainian trace&rdquo;</em> has been detected among foreign fighters in northwestern Syria, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has claimed. The diplomat cited data available on cooperation between Kiev and the terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), including on drones, following a claim Ukraine&rsquo;s intelligence services&nbsp;likely collaborated with the jihadists.</p>
<p>The Kyiv Post has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/608513-terrorists-syria-aleppo-trained-kiev/">reported</a> that Islamist groups involved in recent attacks in Aleppo province could have&nbsp;been prepared by&nbsp;the &lsquo;Khimik&rsquo; Special Forces unit of Ukraine&rsquo;s military intelligence service (HUR), which allegedly provided <em>&ldquo;operational training&rdquo;</em> to militants in Idlib province.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This is not the first region where the Kiev regime applies its criminal experience,&rdquo;</em> Zakharova stated, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2024/12/04/1079165-zaharova-ukazala-na-ukrainskii-sled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cited</a> by newspaper Vedomosti, highlighting previous Ukrainian involvement in conflicts across Africa and now, reportedly, in Syria.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Radicals are clearly trying to undermine years of efforts toward stability in this country, posing serious security risks for civilians, particularly in conflict zones,&rdquo;</em> Zakharova explained. She condemned the use of civilians as human shields, describing it as a disturbing tactic amid the ongoing violence.</p>
<p>Zakharova also suggested that these terrorist acts likely benefit from external support aimed at reigniting conflict in Syria. <em>&ldquo;We express our solidarity with the leadership and people of Syria in this challenging situation,&rdquo;</em> she said, reaffirming Moscow&rsquo;s commitment to the country&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group, formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, and its allies conducted a large-scale surprise attack in northwestern Syria last week. The militants pushed back government forces, seizing significant territory in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Aleppo, Syria&rsquo;s second-largest city, has been under government control since 2016.</p>
<p>HTS is classified as a terrorist organization by Syria, Russia, Iran, the US, and other countries. Its recent actions in Syria mark the first major clash between the jihadists and government forces since March 2020, when a ceasefire was brokered by Russia and T&uuml;rkiye.</p>
<p>Syrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to <em>&ldquo;eliminate terrorists&rdquo;</em> and punish their <em>&ldquo;sponsors and supporters.&rdquo;</em> Damascus has accused Western nations of providing support to terrorist groups in the region. Meanwhile, Russian forces have intensified airstrikes against the militants, maintaining a strong military presence in Syria, with bases in Hmeimim and Tartus.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The president-elect’s crude attempt to scare away de-dollarization is based on an illusion of Washington’s omnipotence</strong></p>


            <p>Donald Trump still has it, that old magic: Long known for using social media to great &ndash; or devastating &ndash; effect, the former and incoming US president has mightily stirred the bubble again. This time the target of his ire is BRICS+ (at this point an informal but commonly used label), an association of, in essence, non-Western states that dare organize and cooperate without Washington&rsquo;s permission and outside its control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1863009545858998512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump has threatened</a> that any attempt to <em>&ldquo;move away from the Dollar&rdquo;</em> will lead to massive US punishment, specifically, <em>&ldquo;100% tariffs.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade,&rdquo;</em> the president-elect thinks he knows, and any country daring to challenge <em>&ldquo;the mighty US Dollar&rdquo;</em> &ndash; in the original over-capitalized, thundering Trumpese &ndash; <em>&ldquo;should wave goodbye to America.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Those who don&rsquo;t want to fall from the good graces of the US, Trump demands, must not only abstain from abandoning the dollar but make a special commitment to not even try.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not dwell on the obvious: To be honest, who would not want to wave the US goodbye, if only we could? And for something that has <em>&ldquo;no chance&rdquo;</em> of happening, the idea of replacing or abandoning the dollar is getting Trump pretty worked up. Why so prickly about what he says is a non-starter anyhow?</p>
<p>Part of the answer &ndash; but only part &ndash; is psychological. Especially during America&rsquo;s ongoing decline, its late-imperial elites, whether Democratic or Republican, are bound to be hyper-sensitive about anything that looks like defiance. Because they are still cultivating a delusion that they are <em>&ldquo;indispensable&rdquo;</em> and that we, the <em>other</em> almost 8 billion people on this planet outside the US, must accept their <em>&ldquo;leadership.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But that complex explains only so much. Because what is special about BRICS is <em>not </em>what it has been trying to do but how successful it is, posing a challenge in the real world of power and geopolitics. Emerging barely two decades ago, just this year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/what-to-know-about-brics-now-doubled-in-size-quicktake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRICS has doubled in size</a>, and further expansion is certain. While it is a complex and evolving organization, one of its prominent concerns has been the escalating American abuse of the dollar as a geopolitical weapon. Hence, BRICS has been a platform for initiatives and discussions under the catch-all label <em>&ldquo;de-dollarization.&rdquo;</em> Indeed, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Bloomberg</a>, members of BRICS have been <em>&ldquo;leading the global debate over dollar exposure.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That is what has triggered Trump, and not for the first time. Months before he won his comeback election, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg<em> </em>reported</a> that he and his advisers were thinking about and issuing threats against de-dollarization. In principle, it is not surprising that they are concerned. What a French finance minister once <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trumps-threat-over-an-imaginary-currency-risks-backfiring-on-the-u-s-dollar-8b50a25a?mod=Searchresults_pos2&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;the exorbitant privilege&rdquo;</em> of the global dollar domination that emerged out of World War II has allowed the US to be profligate with debt. The basis of this anomaly is that, currently, almost 60% of all central bank reserves in the world are held in dollars, and nearly 90% of all foreign-exchange transactions are conducted in the US currency.</p>
<p>As a result, Washington has also been able to avail itself of what <em>The Economist</em>&nbsp;recently labelled <em>&ldquo;an enormous lever of power&rdquo;</em> by surveilling and obstructing global financial flows as well as imposing outright almost-confiscation (euphemized as <em>&ldquo;freezing&rdquo;</em>), as has happened to almost 300 billion dollars of Russia&rsquo;s national reserves. In short, the dollar-as-it-still-is allows the US to live beyond its means at the cost of other nations and to make their lives miserable by the financial equivalent of blackmail, strangulation and, quite simply, robbery.</p>
<p>What is special this time is Trump&rsquo;s hyperbolic tone and his explicit and public singling out of BRICS.</p>
<p>He has leveled his threat at an association that brings together two global powers, Russia and China, as well as several regional heavyweights, such as Iran and Brazil. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-66525474?_hsenc=p2ANqtz--AzbSN6fna92haS99b_QNnu1e7uu1aIv_jsJknGtFKQ7k862SBocglhv-jib6qxkwoNW_v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It already represents at least</a> 45% of the world&rsquo;s population, and, in terms of the global economy, BRICS is a rising force that has already overtaken the G7, the declining club of Western/Global North rich countries.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/the-g7-versus-the-brics-who-wins-7126713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to geopolitical analyst Kishore Mahbubani</a>, at the end of the Cold War, more than a third of a century ago, the combined GDP of the G7 was the equivalent of 66% of global GDP. While BRICS did not exist yet, its future members were far from even getting close to matching the G7. By now, however, the G7 share stands at 45% and that of BRICS+ at 24%. That is, as long as you stick to the crude metric of nominal GDP. Once you adjust, more realistically, for purchasing power, the BRICS+ economies &ndash; with 34% of global GDP &ndash; have already beaten the G7&rsquo;s 29%.&nbsp;</p>

        <![CDATA[


<p>Trump&rsquo;s tweet, in other words, looks as if he were spoiling for an economic fight against two great powers &ndash; one of which is in the process of defeating the West in Ukraine &ndash; and a grouping of states that represents almost half of humanity and is powerful already while growing dynamically. What does Trump&rsquo;s threat actually mean in that context?</p>
<p>To state the obvious, the president-elect&rsquo;s sally squarely stands in the bipartisan US tradition of breathtakingly arrogant over-reach. Between sovereign states, to threaten other countries for potentially <em>not</em> using your currency, including in trades amongst themselves, is absurd. To demand that they promise not to even try makes you look like Tony Soprano on ecstasy, a weird mix between a bully and a crank.</p>
<p>But then, don&rsquo;t blame Trump personally. This is not merely about him being his uncouth self. It&rsquo;s a whole political culture &ndash; for want of a better term &ndash; speaking. The extraordinarily boorish pestering comes from the one, <em>&ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;</em> state on Earth that has got used to the idea that it can interfere in anyone&rsquo;s business all the time and wherever it pleases. Be it by <em>&ldquo;secondary sanctions,&rdquo;</em> that is economic warfare designed to interfere with commercial relationships the US is not even involved in. Or the judicial insanity weaponized against Australian citizen and journalist <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/julian-assange-to-attend-a-pace-hearing-in-strasbourg-on-his-detention-and-conviction-and-their-chilling-effect-on-human-rights-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian Assange</a>, who was persecuted outside the US as if he had to obey American laws, while explicitly <em>not</em> granted even the meager protections that those same laws offer, at least formally, to Americans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No surprise there, really. Trump may think he&rsquo;s very different from the US establishment, but he appears steeped in its self-damaging and shortsighted routine hubris. Yet does his demand even make sense on its own, inappropriate terms? No, not at all, for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, Trump seems to underestimate the sophistication of current de-dollarization discussions centered on BRICS. They are not aiming at the introduction of a new currency akin to the dollar or euro. Indeed, Russia&rsquo;s President Vladimir Putin has been explicit about the fact that the euro can only <a href="https://ria.ru/20231005/briks-1900798767.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serve</a> as an example of how not to do things. Instead, Russia aims at a more intelligent approach by setting up an <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/20/putins-plan-to-dethrone-the-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">international payments system</a>, clearinghouse-style, taking full advantage of cutting-edge digitalization. China, importantly, agrees that it is modern technology that will allow for a gradual recasting of payments around the globe. Whatever will emerge from these initiatives, it will simply be too complex and smart to be amenable to the ham-fisted repression that Trump is trying to threaten.</p>

<p>Secondly, Trump&rsquo;s tweet is self-defeating because the <em>&ldquo;100% tariffs&rdquo;</em> he waves about like a caveman cudgel are simply not believable as a threat &ndash; except, that is, the president-elect is prepared to inflict massive pain on the American economy and its consumers. Even his other tariff threats, against China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU, especially in conjunction with his unrealistic promises of tax cuts, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trumps-economic-plan-has-inflation-written-all-over-it-fcbb8204?mod=Searchresults_pos3&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imply rising prices and inflation in the US</a>. And inflation played an important role in the defeat of the Democrats.</p>
<p>Finally, Trump&rsquo;s approach is also self-defeating because it offers further incentives to de-dollarize, as even some Western experts acknowledge. The president-elect has illustrated exactly the kind of brutal and dumb overreach and, to put it simply, flagrant disrespect of other countries&rsquo; financial sovereignty that has antagonized the world in the first place. This kind of backfiring is precisely what the Russian presidency&rsquo;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov has just <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/kremlin-says-trump-threat-to-brics-nations-against-replacing-us-dollar-will-backfire/ar-AA1v6UPH?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned</a> the US about.</p>
<p>But perhaps, to be fair to Trump, there is another way to understand his threats against reducing dollar dependency: namely as a perversely misguided attempt to repair the enormous damage done by US economic warfare under previous administrations, including those of his two Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and his own as well.</p>
<p>Most of that damage was done in Washington&rsquo;s gargantuan yet failing campaign against Russia. Before exiting the White House in 2017, Obama had already increased sanctions against Russia <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">substantially</a>.&rdquo;</em> Subsequently, there was a relative lull during the first Trump administration. Where Obama had added 458 sanction targets, Trump still added more &ndash; 273 &ndash; but at a <em>&ldquo;much lower rate&rdquo;</em>: In the US, moderation is doing the same bad thing but more slowly. Congress, meanwhile, made sure that the president would have found it hard to reduce sanctions, even if he had wanted to, by passing the Countering America&rsquo;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Biden&rsquo;s rule after 2021, then, US sanctions against Russia went from bad to worse: After the 2022 escalation, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/how-us-sanctions-torpedoed-kamala-harris/ar-AA1umv1l?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biden boasted</a> that his sanctions were <em>&ldquo;the toughest ever imposed on a major economy.&rdquo;</em> And, as before, the US was leading an international assault, including the EU and other American clients, such as Canada and Japan. By February of 2024, together they had ramped up the total of sanctions launched with the explicit intent to destroy Russia economically <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to 16,500</a>.</p>

<p>This historically unprecedented economic warfare attack has not only failed but backfired, as is well known. Western speculators, especially in the US, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/how-us-sanctions-torpedoed-kamala-harris/ar-AA1umv1l?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have enriched themselves</a> (again) through a number of perverse side effects &ndash; or were they main effects maybe? &ndash; as a recent <em>Jacobin</em> article shows. The inflation backlash triggered may well have contributed to the Democrats smashing defeat in the presidential elections, as noted before. The poor of the world have certainly suffered. And so have major economies as well, especially in a EU-NATO Europe, whose elites have consistently sacrificed the interests and well-being of their own countries, as Russian president Putin has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62817560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeatedly</a> and correctly pointed out. &nbsp;So bad has the fall-out been that even the British Telegraph, as NATO-bellicist as can be, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/06/european-sanctions-on-putin-damage-europe/?msockid=14ee70ec34386f2036a3646535fe6e0d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has long noticed</a>.</p>
<p>Trump, facing this total fiasco, you could say, is now desperately attempting to contain one aspect of its continuing fall-out, namely the drive toward de-dollarization. But the tragedy &ndash; or irony &ndash; is that he is trying to do so by applying even more of the same stupid highhandedness that got us into this mess in the first place. Instead of doing what is obviously needed &ndash; drop sanctions and economic warfare in general, including via weaponizing the dollar &ndash; he is adding more crude threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems, Trump not only has but obstinately cultivates the same mental blind spot as virtually everyone else in the current US elite: He implicitly believes that American power has no limits, and certainly none set by the power of other states. Trump <em>does</em> believe that Washington can make mistakes, because otherwise he could not claim to correct them and <em>&ldquo;make America great again.&rdquo;</em> But he cannot grasp that repairing America&rsquo;s place in the world would take genuine cooperation with others outside the US. Instead, he is betting on yet more bullying. Good luck with that.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Odessa councillors have voted to dismantle a statue of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin</strong></p>


            <p>The city council in the Ukrainian city of Odessa approved on Wednesday a plan to dismantle the local statue of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, despite the structure being designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The monument was installed on Odessa&rsquo;s Primorsky Boulevard in 1889 using funds donated by residents to mark the time that Pushkin spent in the city. The poet and writer, considered the founder of modern Russian literature, spent 14 months in the Black Sea port, which was a part of the Russian Empire at the time.</p>
<p>According to the news website <a href="https://strana.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-entity-type="MessageEntityUrl">Strana.ua</a>, lawmakers unanimously adopted amendments to the city budget, allocating funds for the dismantling of 12 monuments containing <em>&ldquo;imperial symbols.&rdquo;</em> Aside from the statue on Primorsky Boulevard, the list reportedly also includes a full-height statue of the Russian poet on Italyanskaya Street. Formerly Pushkinskaya, the street was renamed in July.</p>
<p>The idea of demolishing the statue was put forward by the regional governor, Oleg Kiper. In September, he claimed the government in Kiev had excluded monuments to Soviet and Russian figures from the national register of cultural sites, automatically removing them from UNESCO protection.</p>
<p>Since the start of Moscow&rsquo;s military operation in 2022, the campaign to remove historical links to Russia and its culture has intensified in Ukraine. As part of the movement, Kiev has passed a law on the <em>&ldquo;decolonization&rdquo;</em> of street signs, monuments, memorials, and inscriptions.</p>

<p>Odessa Mayor Gennady Trukhanov has <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/600758-odessa-ukraine-pushkin-monument/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed</a> the idea of demolishing the monuments, including Pushkin and 19th Century political figure Prince Mikhail Vorontsov. He compared those insisting on their removal, due to the conflict with Moscow, to ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Trukhanov insisted that structures erected by <em>&ldquo;our great-great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers&rdquo;</em> should remain in place.</p>
<p>In December 2022, a statue of Catherine the Great was torn down in Odessa, even though the city was founded on her orders in 1794. Several Ukrainian cities, including Dnepr and Chernovtsy, have removed statues and memorial plaques dedicated to Pushkin.</p>
<p>Moscow has repeatedly denounced Kiev&rsquo;s crackdown on Russian culture and language, insisting that <em>&ldquo;forced Ukrainization&rdquo;</em> violates international law and infringes on the rights of around a quarter of Ukraine&rsquo;s population, who are Russian-speaking.</p>]]>

<p><em>&ldquo;Nowadays, everything from the East is better than from the West,&rdquo;</em> he told the forum. <em>&ldquo;Look at the conditions that are being created for the German economy here in Russia, and by your traditional allies and partners &ndash; now we are only talking about the business environment.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But our doors are always open, we have always had very good relations with Germany for decades, we understood each other very well,&rdquo;</em> the president said.</p>

                            <p><strong>Republican Mike Johnson is opposed to a new $24 billion request from the White House</strong></p>


            <p>The US House of Representatives will not consider President Joe Biden&rsquo;s request to include $24 billion in additional aid to Ukraine in a government funding bill, Speaker Mike Johnson has said.</p>
<p>In the absence of a formal budget, the US government has been funded through <em>&ldquo;continuing resolutions&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;periodically approved by Congress. The White House has requested the $24 billion as part of its latest proposed legislation, which the House would need to adopt before adjourning for Christmas holidays.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not planning to do that,&rdquo;</em> Johnson said on Wednesday, at a press conference on Capitol Hill. <em>&ldquo;It is not the place of Joe Biden to make that decision now.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican reminded reporters that he had predicted Donald Trump&rsquo;s election would change the dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and make further US funding unnecessary, adding that this is precisely what&rsquo;s been happening in recent weeks.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We have a newly-elected president and we&rsquo;re going to wait an</em><em>d take the new commander-in-chief&rsquo;s direction on all of that,&rdquo; </em>Johnson said. <em>&ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t expect any Ukraine funding to come up now.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Since February 2022, the US Congress has approved more than $174 billion to prop up Ukraine in its ongoing military conflict with Russia. The latest batch of funding, amounting to $61 billion, was held up for several months amid a battle between Johnson and the White House.</p>
<p>The previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was ousted last October because a group of Republicans was outraged he had secretly negotiated with Democrats to get the Ukraine funding approved. The funding ended up stuck in Congress for almost six months, before it was approved in both the Senate and the House in April, with no concessions to the GOP.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The scenario is included in the institution’s annual set of ‘outrageous’ predictions</strong></p>


            <p>Denmark&rsquo;s Saxo Bank has released its annual list of <em>&ldquo;outrageous predictions,&rdquo;</em> considering some possible but unlikely events that could shake up global financial markets in 2025.</p>
<p>According to the investment bank&rsquo;s outlook, next year the world will strive to find alternatives to the US dollar after the incoming Donald Trump administration slaps massive tariffs on imports, while cutting government spending with the help of an Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The implications for the US dollar are dire for trade around the world, as it cuts off the needed supply of dollars to keep the wheels of the global USD system turning, ironically risking a powerful spike higher in the US dollar,&rdquo;</em> said Saxo&rsquo;s chief macro strategist, John Hardy.</p>
<p>As a result the crypto market would quadruple to more than $10 trillion, while the dollar would tumble 20% against major currencies and 30% versus gold.</p>
<p>Analysts at the Copenhagen-based bank also predict that chip-maker Nvidia&rsquo;s market value could balloon to double that of Apple, &lsquo;supercharged&rsquo; with greater availability of its revolutionary 208-billion transistor Blackwell chip.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With the intensifying AI arms race as no giant or even government wants to be left behind, and as AI data centre electricity costs have soared, the insatiable demand for the more powerful and yet less power-hungry Blackwell chips sees Nvidia taking the crown as the most profitable company of all time,&rdquo;</em> the bank said.</p>

<p>This could send Nvidia&rsquo;s share price soaring from its already high level of nearly $139 to <em>&ldquo;well north&rdquo;</em> of $250, leading the market to question how high it can go.</p>
<p>Another event that could send shockwaves across global markets would be China unleashing a fiscal stimulus of 50 trillion yuan ($7 trillion) in 2025 and in the following years, to <em>&ldquo;reflate&rdquo;</em> its economy.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Much of the spending goes directly into consumers&rsquo; pockets via e-CNY digital currency, so that it will be injected straight into the economy rather than to pay off debt,&rdquo;</em> the bank&rsquo;s Chief Investment Strategist Charu Chanana wrote.</p>
<p>The measures could lead to a <em>&ldquo;strong reflationary impact&rdquo;</em> in China and the world, as well as higher commodity prices, according to the strategist.</p>
<p>In another unlikely prediction by the bank, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could become <em>&ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo;</em> next year amid soaring popularity and affordability of electric vehicles.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With some members already cheating production quotas to grab what income they can and export demand falling, a majority of members quickly realise the jig is up. Amidst the bickering and in-fighting, key members leave. This consigns OPEC to the ash heap of history. Former members max out production to ensure market share, driving a large drop in oil prices,&rdquo;</em> Saxo wrote.</p>
<p>Other predictions for 2025 included the UK pound sterling erasing the post-Brexit discount against the euro, the US imposing a <em>&ldquo;huge&rdquo;</em> AI data center tax amid a power price surge, and the first fully functional human heart being bio-printed using 3D bioprinting technology.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>UnitedHealthcare head Brian Thompson was ambushed and fatally shot in Manhattan</strong></p>


            <p>A masked attacker opened fire on UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday morning in Manhattan, the New York Police Department has said. The executive died after being rushed to a local hospital.</p>
<p>UnitedHealthcare is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest health insurance companies in the US. Thompson, 50, was scheduled to speak at their investor conference at the Hilton Midtown in New York City.</p>
<p>At 6:46am, as Thompson approached the venue, a masked man who had been <em>&ldquo;milling around&rdquo;</em> in the vicinity of the hotel pulled out a gun and opened fire, police told local media.</p>
<p>Thompson was struck in the chest multiple times. He was taken to an area hospital in critical condition but succumbed to his injuries.<br />The NYPD suspects a <em>&ldquo;targeted attack,&rdquo;</em> according to Bloomberg and local outlet WPIX-TV.</p>
<p>Witnesses told the New York Post that the man had been spotted near the hotel, apparently waiting for Thompson. He was described as a white male wearing a cream-colored jacket, a black face mask, and a gray backpack.</p>
<p>After shooting Thompson, he fled down an alley on foot and jumped on a bicycle to flee the scene, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>Investigators are looking for CCTV footage that could help them identify the shooter, the New York Daily News reported. The NYPD suspects that the gunman had been waiting in the alley for Thompson and that the shooting may have been a contract hit.</p>
<p>Thompson had started working for UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and became the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in 2021.</p>
<p>UnitedHealth&rsquo;s investor conference was called off about an hour later when a spokesman told everyone in attendance that the company was <em>&ldquo;dealing with a very serious&hellip; situation.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze previously accused the West of trying to orchestrate a Maidan-like coup in the country</strong></p>


            <p>Up to a third of those identified at recent protests in&nbsp;Georgias capital Tbilisi&nbsp;have turned out to be foreign nationals, according to the executive secretary of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Mamuka Mdinaradze.</p>
<p>Anti-government protests broke out in the Georgian capital last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that he would be&nbsp;suspending accession talks with the EU due to Brussels&rsquo; <em>&ldquo;constant blackmail and manipulation&rdquo;</em> of the former Soviet republic&rsquo;s domestic politics.</p>
<p>Pro-EU protesters have since taken to the streets and repeatedly clashed with law enforcement, setting off fireworks and throwing Molotov cocktails at riot police, as well as setting fire to the parliament building. Law enforcement officials have in turn deployed tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse the protesters, over 200 of whom have reportedly been arrested.</p>
<p>More than 110 police officers have also been injured during the protests.</p>
<p>Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday, Mdinaradze claimed that <em>&ldquo;30% of the people who were identified at the protests in Tbilisi are citizens of other countries.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Someone has to explain this strangeness. Why are these foreign citizens so upset after our decision?&rdquo;</em> the politician asked, noting that there were many Russian citizens among the detained protesters, as well as people from the US, the UK and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Following the escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev in 2022, Georgia became one of the primary destinations for Russian citizens who disagreed with Russia&rsquo;s policies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kobakhidze slammed the protests as an <em>&ldquo;attack on the constitutional order&rdquo;</em> in Georgia, and blamed the civil unrest on <em>&ldquo;EU politicians and their agents.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>He also claimed that the West was trying to orchestrate a Maidan-style revolution in Georgia, referring to the US-backed coup in Kiev in 2014, which ousted the country&rsquo;s democratically elected president and precipitated the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Georgian leader has said that those behind the protests will not be able to realize the Maidan scenario in his country because, <em>&ldquo;unlike Ukraine in 2013, Georgia is an independent state with strong institutions and, most importantly, experienced and wise people.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Moscow has also compared the anti-government protests in Georgia to the Maidan coup, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating that the unrest exhibits <em>&ldquo;all the signs of an attempt to carry out an &lsquo;orange revolution&rsquo;.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

            <p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s advisers have presented him with three plans for resolving the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Reuters has reported, citing several sources close to the US president-elect.</p>
<p>Despite certain differences, all of the proposals include Kiev ceding territory to Moscow and giving up on its aspiration to join NATO, the agency said in an article on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A former Trump national security official, involved in the ongoing government transition in the US, has told Reuters that one of the plans came from the president-elect&rsquo;s incoming Russia-Ukraine envoy, retired Army Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg.</p>
<p>The other two were authored by Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and Trump&rsquo;s former acting intelligence chief, Richard Grenell, respectively, according to the official.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s advisers reportedly intend&nbsp;to try to pressure the two countries&nbsp;into negotiations by using a <em>&ldquo;carrots and sticks&rdquo;</em> strategy, Reuters said. It would see Washington halting military aid to Kiev if Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky refuses to negotiate, and more arms deliveries if Russian President Vladimir Putin expresses an unwillingness to engage in diplomacy, the outlet explained.</p>
<p>As of last week, Trump had yet to convene a central working group to flesh out a unified peace plan, four advisers told the agency on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The deal between Moscow and Kiev will likely depend on direct personal engagement between Trump, Putin, and Zelensky, the advisers stressed.</p>
<p>During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that he would end the fighting between Moscow and Kiev within 24 hours if he is reelected, but never explained how exactly he was going to achieve this.</p>

<p>Zelensky, who previously vigorously rejected the possibility of making any concessions to Moscow, has recently softened his stance on the issue. He told Kyodo News on Monday that Ukraine <em>&ldquo;could even cede some territories, which we cannot return today&rdquo;</em> to Russia and try getting them back through diplomatic means later.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian leader also insisted that guaranteed NATO membership for Kiev must be a condition for signing a truce, as it will put Ukraine in <em>&ldquo;a strong position&rdquo;</em> in the event that a new conflict breaks out with Russia.</p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow&rsquo;s readiness to look for a diplomatic solution. For it to be achieved, the <em>&ldquo;root causes&rdquo;</em> of the conflict must be eliminated, including NATO&rsquo;s eastward expansion and <em>&ldquo;systematic&rdquo;</em> violations of the rights of Russian speakers by the Kiev government, he said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The former German chancellor claims the Russian president brought his pet to a 2007 meeting despite knowing that she is afraid of dogs</strong></p>


            <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin deliberately brought his Labrador dog to a meeting they held back in 2007 to <em>&ldquo;test&rdquo;</em> her. The veteran politician insisted that Putin was aware that she feels uneasy around canines.</p>
<p>Black Labrador Koni briefly joined the pair during talks in Sochi, Russia 17 years ago. The former head of the German government was reportedly bitten by a dog back in 1995, and has been wary of them since then.</p>
<p>Recalling the encounter in an interview with CNN&rsquo;s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Merkel said: <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little, small attempt to test the waters &ndash; you know, how resilient a person is, how strong.&rdquo;</em> She argued that it was unlikely that Putin had simply forgotten about her dislike of dogs, since her aide had warned Russian officials about it beforehand.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a power play,&rdquo;</em> she concluded.</p>
<p>In her recently published memoir, titled &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo;, Merkel similarly wrote that Putin had <em>&ldquo;intended to make a statement, even with the help of his Labrador Koni, if necessary.&rdquo;</em> The former chancellor recalled how she had tried to ignore the dog and keep her cool during the meeting.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I interpreted Putin&rsquo;s facial expressions to mean that he was enjoying the situation. Did he just want to see how a person in distress reacts?&rdquo;</em> she asked in her book.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters late last month, the Russian president reiterated that he had no idea about Merkel&rsquo;s fear of dogs prior to their 2007 encounter.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If I had known about it </em>[back then]<em>, I would have never done it,&rdquo;</em> he insisted, adding that by bringing Koni along, he was in fact hoping to create a <em>&ldquo;relaxed, pleasant atmosphere.&rdquo;</em> He understood from his personal experience of living in Germany that <em>&ldquo;people there have a very positive attitude towards pets.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I thought she would enjoy it. Later, I found out that she is afraid of dogs,&rdquo;</em> Putin said, noting that <em>&ldquo;when I found out, I apologized to her.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Russian president addressed the ex-German chancellor directly: <em>&ldquo;Angela, please forgive me. I did not want to distress you in any way.&rdquo;<br /></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you ever come </em>[to Russia]<em>, I realize that it is unlikely today, I will not do it again,&rdquo; </em>Putin added.</p>

                            <p><strong>Encouraging minors to take part in riots is “extremely disturbing,” the country’s Patriarchate has warned</strong></p>


            <p>The Patriarchate of the Georgian Orthodox Church has blasted the country&rsquo;s president, Salome Zourabichvili, for calling on schools to back ongoing pro-EU protests in Tbilisi, given the violent tactics used by some rioters.</p>
<p>Any statements <em>&ldquo;aimed at inciting the involvement of schoolchildren and, in general, minors, especially [such statements] made by the country&rsquo;s president, are extremely disturbing,&rdquo;</em> the Patriarchate said on Tuesday, according to local media.</p>
<p>Earlier, hundreds of university lecturers expressed support for the demonstrations and encouraged their students to take part.</p>
<p>The Church said that, instead of instigating unrest, the head of state <em>&ldquo;should work to reduce the polarization and hatred in society, so that the mental and physical health of the future generation will not be harmed by the current events.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Madam Salome, I hope that, after schools, you will not call on kindergartens to participate in protests,&rdquo;</em> the head of the Georgian Patriarchate&rsquo;s press service, Archpriest Andria Dzhagmaidze, wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>The Church reacted after Zourabichvili wrote on X on Monday: <em>&ldquo;After universities, it is the turn of schools to express their solidarity with the protests, all over Georgia.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is unclear whether Zourabichvili, whose six-year term in office is due to end, was calling on minors and teenagers to take to the streets or on their schools to issue a declaration of support.</p>
<p>Mass protests were organized over the outcome of the general election in early November. Further escalation followed last week after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that he would freeze talks about Georgia joining the EU until 2028, due to Brussels&rsquo; <em>&ldquo;constant blackmail and manipulation&rdquo;</em> of internal politics in Tbilisi.</p>
<p>Kobakhidze has denounced the demonstrations as an <em>&ldquo;attack on the constitutional order in the country&rdquo;</em> and has accused the West of an attempt to orchestrate a coup similar to the US-backed Maidan revolution in Ukraine in 2014, warning that such a scenario <em>&ldquo;cannot be realized in Georgia.&rdquo;</em></p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah won more than 57% of the votes cast last week, the African nation’s electoral authority has stated</strong></p>


            <p>Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the Namibian ruling party's candidate in last week&rsquo;s disputed presidential election, has been declared the winner and becomes the Southern African nation&rsquo;s first female president, according to official results.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old member of the South West Africa People&rsquo;s Organisation (SWAPO) party received over 57% of the votes cast, the Electoral Commission of Namibia announced Tuesday evening. Her main rival, Panduleni Itula of the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) party, attracted 25.50% of the vote.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Namibian nation has voted for peace and stability,&rdquo;</em> Reuters quoted the president-elect as saying following the declaration of the results.</p>
<p>On assuming office, Nandi-Ndaitwah will join Tanzania&rsquo;s Samia Suluhu Hassan as the only current female leaders in Africa.</p>
<p>Her victory extends SWAPO&rsquo;s 34-year rule in the large but sparsely populated country (population 2.6 million). The party has remained in power since Namibia gained independence in 1990 and despite ongoing dissatisfaction over unemployment, poverty, and corruption.</p>

<p>Support for SWAPO had fallen from 87% in the 2014 presidential election to 56% in 2019, with speculation that it might lose its grip on power in this year&rsquo;s elections. In neighboring South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC), in power since the end of the racist apartheid system there, lost its majority in a historic election in June. Similarly, the Botswana Democratic Party <a href="https://www.rt.com/africa/606864-botswana-ruling-party-loses-election/">lost</a> power to the opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change in October, ending nearly six decades of its rule in the country.</p>
<p>Former Namibian President Hage Geingob appointed Nandi-Ndaitwah (often referred-to as &lsquo;NNN&rsquo;) as a candidate for SWAPO in March 2023. She became the vice president to Nangolo Mbumba, who took over the presidency after Geingob died in February. The politician had served as the minister of environment and tourism between March 2010 and December 2012. In the mid-1970s, she completed a course at the Lenin Higher Komsomol School in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Nandi-Ndaitwah has recognized unemployment as her country&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;biggest challenge&rdquo;</em> and has promised to prioritize job creation, particularly for young people. She has attributed worsening economic conditions to droughts and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Namibians also elected members of the National Assembly during the November 27 general elections, which were marred by technical difficulties and, in some areas, required a three-day extension of voting. SWAPO won a majority in the assembly, with 51 of the 96 elected seats.</p>
<p>Panduleni Itula&rsquo;s IPC party, the main opposition group, won 20 seats, but the leader has threatened to challenge the results in court, citing <em>&ldquo;glaring and undeniable&rdquo;</em> electoral irregularities.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We shall not, under any circumstances, recognize the outcome of the 2024 election... that is still, in our opinion, illegitimately continuing,&rdquo;</em> the 67-year-old former dentist and lawyer told reporters on Saturday.</p>
<p>In protest over the results, several other opposition parties boycotted the election authority&rsquo;s announcement ceremony in the capital, Windhoek, newspaper The Namibian reported on Wednesday.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The bloc plans to have sea surveillance in the Atlantic and Mediterranean by next June, a senior official has told Defense News</strong></p>


            <p>NATO military commanders want to launch a fleet of unmanned surface watercraft and later submersibles to monitor the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, Defense News reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The project is based on a similar US program in the Persian Gulf, and could be started before the next NATO Summit, to be held in the Netherlands in June 2025, French Adm. Pierre Vandier, who holds the position of NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, told the news website. The official compared the idea to city CCTV cameras, saying the <em>&ldquo;technology is there&rdquo;</em> to implement such a system.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;In fact, it already exists, so somehow it&rsquo;s not very risky. The US has enforced Task Force 59 in the Gulf for years, so everything is known and sold, so it is much more a matter of adoption than technology,&rdquo;</em> Vandier explained.</p>
<p>The admiral was referring to a project launched by the US Navy&rsquo;s 5th Fleet in September 2021 to monitor some 2.5 million square miles (6.5 million square kilometres) of water in the Middle East area of operations. Earlier this year, the US created a sub-unit of the task force, operating out of Bahrain, to integrate manned and unmanned missions.</p>

<p>Vandier said the NATO project has support from the organization&rsquo;s central command of maritime forces and its operational headquarters. The outlet suggested it was moving forward due to a <em>&ldquo;pattern of undersea cable damage across European waters,&rdquo;</em> which some Western officials have blamed on Russia despite a lack of evidence.</p>
<p>The latest such incident was reported this week and involved a link between Finland and Sweden, NATO&rsquo;s two newest members. Swedish Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin claimed on Tuesday that sabotage could have been involved, but Finnish officials later confirmed that at least one of the two identified breaks was caused by construction work.</p>
<p>Vandier was approved for his NATO post in June. He previously served as Chief of Staff of the French Navy and commanded the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.</p>
<p>The French military has been trying to integrate robotic Airbus Helicopters VSR700 rotorcraft to be flown from its warships, but the SDAM program has suffered from delays and requirement changes, according to local media.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The country’s businesses are adapting and thriving as trade continues to grow, the president has said</strong></p>


            <p>Western attempts to defeat Russia on all fronts, including inflicting damage to the country&rsquo;s economy, have clearly failed, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The elites of <em>&ldquo;certain nations&rdquo;</em> have proven to be unreliable trade partners as they have tried to damage Russian interests in recent years, Putin said in his opening speech at the Russia Calling! investment forum.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We often hear that those nations set the goal to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia in political, military and economic spheres. Including in terms of economics and technology,&rdquo;</em> he stated.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;They sought to drastically weaken our industry, finances, the service industry in our country, to create an insurmountable deficit of goods in our market, to destabilize the labor market, to degrade living standards for our citizens.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Russian economy has not only recovered from the initial damage caused by the attacks on it, but has also undergone a structural transformation beneficial to it, Putin added. The government has worked hard to improve the logistics of international trade used by Russian businesses and strengthen ties with friendly partners, which has helped the national economy to grow, he stressed.</p>

<p>The Russian government and businesses are working on improving the national financial infrastructure by introducing novel mechanisms, such as remote identification of clients by banks, Putin said. Such changes require a legal framework, and they make the national currency more convenient for international trade.</p>
<p>The expression <em>&ldquo;strategic defeat&rdquo;</em> was used by the administration of US President Joe Biden to describe the consequences that the Ukraine conflict would supposedly have for Russia. Washington and its allies have seized Russian state assets and imposed unilateral economic restrictions, as well as threatening third parties with punishment should they trade with Russia in a way not sanctioned by the West.</p>
<p>Despite Western efforts, Russia remains strongly active in international trade. Some nations in the EU continue buying Russian-sourced energy, openly defying Brussels&rsquo; calls to divest, while others do so through intermediaries, according to researchers monitoring supplies. Last month, Bloomberg warned that the latest round of US sanctions, which targeted Russia&rsquo;s Gazprombank, threaten to cause an energy crisis in Western Europe.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The prosecutor general’s office claims the US-based quasi-religious organization supports “members of extremist and terrorist movements”</strong></p>


            <p>Russian authorities have designated the US-based Satanic Temple as an undesirable organization, claiming that the quasi-religious group justifies violence and supports extremist and terrorist entities.</p>
<p>Under Russian law, any foreign or international organization which is believed to pose a threat to the country&rsquo;s security and political system can be labeled undesirable. This status essentially prohibits such entities from operating in Russia; their bank accounts are frozen and local branches are shut down. Those found in breach of the law could face fines or even prison sentences under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Since the legislation came into force in 2015, numerous not-for-profit organizations have had to close their doors in Russia, including the Church of Scientology and the Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the prosecutor general&rsquo;s office said that the <em>&ldquo;so-called Satanic Temple was registered in the US in 2012&rdquo;</em> by several Harvard University graduates. According to Russian officials, the group has 23 chapters in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany, Finland and several other nations. It is believed to have over 10 million members worldwide.</p>
<p>The Russian authorities claimed that the organization <em>&ldquo;promotes occult ideologies </em>[and]<em> uses Satanic imagery to discredit traditional spiritual-ethical values.&rdquo;</em> The Satanic Temple, which allegedly enjoys US government support, also justifies violence and <em>&ldquo;actively backs members of extremist and terrorist movements,&rdquo;</em> the prosecutor general&rsquo;s office explained.</p>

<p>Moreover, the group is said to oppose Russia&rsquo;s military campaign against Ukraine and to have organized fundraisers to support Kiev&rsquo;s armed forces.</p>
<p>According to the group&rsquo;s website, it does not believe in the existence of Satan or the supernatural in general, but rather views its titular figure as a <em>&ldquo;symbol of the Eternal Rebel in opposition to arbitrary authority, forever defending personal sovereignty even in the face of insurmountable odds.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The organization headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts says it stands for science-oriented rational inquiry and critical thinking, and opposes archaic <em>&ldquo;tradition-based superstitions&rdquo;</em> as well as <em>&ldquo;all tyrannical impositions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The entity, which is distinct from Anton LaVey&rsquo;s Church of Satan, has been lobbying a number of causes, including abortion rights and bodily autonomy.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>A shooter believed to be a former Khalistan militant opened fire at the famous Sikh shrine in Amritsar</strong></p>


            <p>Prominent Sikh politician Sukhbir Singh Badal has survived an assassination attempt after a gunman opened fire outside the Golden Temple in Amritsar, northern India, on Wednesday. The temple is a holy shrine for the Sikh community and the site of tragic events in the 1980s, when hundreds were killed during an Indian government operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shooter was quickly apprehended by police and was later identified as Narain Singh Chaura, a former Khalistani militant with a history of legal issues, according to Hindustan Times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Badal, a former deputy chief minister of Punjab and a leading figure in the Shiromani Akali Dal party, was in a wheelchair when the incident occurred. He escaped injury as the bullet struck a nearby wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attack was captured on camera by journalists assembled at the temple, where Badal was performing the duty of &lsquo;sewadar&rsquo; &ndash; a term for volunteers who assist in gurdwaras and community services for religious reasons. This act was part of his atonement for what he termed the <em>&ldquo;mistakes&rdquo;</em> made during his tenure from 2007 to 2017, according to officials from the Akal Takht, the highest religious authority in Sikhism.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Thanks to the vigilance and deployment of our police, this attempt was thwarted,&rdquo;</em> said Amritsar Police Commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar, confirming the arrest of the gunman. The motive behind the attack remains unclear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shooting echoes the violence of 1984, when then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered military action at the Golden Temple to dislodge armed Sikh separatist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers. This operation &ndash; code-named Blue Star &ndash; enraged Sikhs globally and spurred the Khalistan movement, which advocates for an independent Sikh state carved out of Punjab and surrounding areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Khalistan movement has been central to rising tensions between India and Canada, especially following allegations from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that India was involved in the assassination in British Columbia of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a key figure in the Khalistan separatist movement. India views Khalistan as a national threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tensions escalated in October when Canadian officials accused Indian diplomats of targeting Sikh activists in Canada, leading both nations to expel six diplomats in retaliation. Trudeau condemned India&rsquo;s actions as a <em>&ldquo;fundamental error,&rdquo;</em> while New Delhi denied the allegations, claiming they were part of a broader strategy to undermine India for political gain. Despite the challenges, the Sikh diaspora in Canada wields considerable electoral power, although extreme factions within the Khalistan movement represent a minority.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Cadets and officers from the Assad Military Engineering School broke through the encirclement in Aleppo</strong></p>


            <p>Syrian Army cadets and officers have been rescued in a joint Syrian-Russian counter-terrorism operation carried out to break through a siege by Islamist militants in the northwestern city of Aleppo, the country&rsquo;s Defense Ministry has said.</p>
<p>According to a statement published on Facebook on Wednesday, cadets from the Assad Military Engineering Academy near Aleppo fought off the terrorists before being aided by&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;joint Syrian-Russian military-political coordination.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Jihadists had stormed the academy with various types of medium- and heavy-caliber weapons and advanced drones, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The students were later encircled again by groups of terrorists armed with heavy vehicles, including tanks, artillery, machine guns, and drones, the statement added. As a result, some of the cadets and officers were killed and others injured, although the ministry did not provide figures.</p>

<p>The siege was eventually lifted through a joint Syrian-Russian military cooperation, the ministry added. The academy students have safely arrived in the western city of Homs, where they were provided with the necessary care and medical treatment, the statement said.</p>
<p>The situation in Syria has deteriorated rapidly after the Hayat Tahrir-al-Sham (HTS) terrorist group (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra) and its allies launched a large-scale surprise attack in the northwestern part of the country last week. The insurgents pushed back government forces and captured significant chunks of territory in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Aleppo, which is the second-largest city in the country, had been under Syrian government control since 2016.</p>
<p>HTS is considered a terrorist organization by Syria, Russia, Iran, the US, and several other countries.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s Islamist attack was the first major clash between jihadist and Syrian government forces since March 2020, when Russia and T&uuml;rkiye brokered a ceasefire in the country.</p>

<p>Reacting to the resumption of fighting in Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan voiced a commitment to the territorial integrity of Syria, saying that Ankara wants the conflict to be resolved in accordance with the <em>&ldquo;legitimate wishes&rdquo;</em> of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>Syrian President Bashar Assad has pledged to <em>&ldquo;eliminate terrorists&rdquo;</em> and to punish their <em>&ldquo;sponsors and supporters.&rdquo;</em> Damascus has long accused Western states and their allies of aiding terrorist groups operating in the region.</p>
<p>The Syrian forces have reportedly succeeded in halting the insurgents in central parts of the country&nbsp;after receiving reinforcements. The Russian expeditionary force in Syria has come to the aid of Damascus by launching constant airstrikes against the militants.</p>
<p>Moscow&nbsp;intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2015, helping to inflict heavy defeats on numerous terrorist groups, most notably al-Nusra and Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Russia maintains a significant military presence in the country and has bases in Hmeimim and Tartus.</p>
<p>This week, the Kremlin reiterated Russia&rsquo;s support for the Syrian government, stating that Moscow and Damascus had been in contact and were analyzing ongoing developments.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>As militants move on the city of two million, Damascus’ military weakness and Tehran’s inaction raise questions about the future</strong></p>


            <p>The recent escalation in northwest Syria has placed Aleppo at the center of renewed conflict, following clashes that broke out shortly after a ceasefire was announced in Lebanon. This unexpected flare-up marks the beginning of a new phase of violence not seen in four years, as a coalition of armed groups, including the T&uuml;rkiye-backed Syrian National Army and jihadist factions like the Levant Liberation Organization (formerly Jebhat al-Nusra), launched a calculated offensive on the city of over two million inhabitants.</p>
<p>The battle for Aleppo is about more than just the city itself. It&rsquo;s a microcosm of the broader regional power struggles that have defined Syria&rsquo;s civil war. This renewed offensive calls into question the stability of the region as well as the efficacy of diplomatic efforts by the rest of the world. Despite international attempts to broker peace, Syria remains deeply divided and now, more than ever, the geopolitical stakes in Aleppo couldn&rsquo;t be higher.</p>
<p>In a well-coordinated attack, fighters from several militant groups entered the city&rsquo;s western suburbs, advancing toward Saadallah al-Jabri Square, the symbolic center of the city. This marks a shift in strategy, as these groups had already seized significant territory in the north and west of Aleppo, as well as parts of eastern Idlib. For many locals, the rapid advance of militants is a shocking development, a grim reminder that peace is still far from reach.</p>
<p>The Syrian army&rsquo;s response has been underwhelming. Its defense ministry issued a statement acknowledging a <em>&ldquo;large-scale&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;unexpected&rdquo;</em> attack by opposition forces but failed to present a convincing counteroffensive strategy. Reports have also surfaced of airstrikes by Russian and Syrian forces targeting the supply routes of militants in the suburbs of Aleppo and Idlib. These efforts may not tip the balance, casting doubt over Damascus&rsquo; capacity to hold off the insurgents in the face of this new wave of aggression.</p>

<p>Syria&rsquo;s second-largest city, Aleppo is both an economic hub and a vital stronghold for the government&rsquo;s control over the country. Its capture by extremist groups would be a devastating blow to Damascus&rsquo; authority. Situated less than 200 miles (310 kms) from the capital, the ancient city holds both symbolic and strategic importance. Its fall would shift the balance of power in Syria and would severely weaken the government of Bashar Assad.</p>
<p>What makes this latest battle even more complex is the role of Iran, whose forces have a significant presence in Syria. Despite the large number of Iranian military facilities &ndash; including 52 military bases and 177 additional sites in Aleppo &ndash; Iranian forces have failed to take decisive action against the advancing terrorist groups. This inaction raises questions about Tehran&rsquo;s strategy in Syria, as its military infrastructure seems increasingly vulnerable to attacks from more agile opposition forces.</p>
<p>Why has Iran, with its substantial military presence, failed to counter these groups effectively? The absence of air support and a broader reliance on Syrian infrastructure could be major factors in this failure. On top of these shortcomings, Iranian forces have been hesitant to engage directly, perhaps due to the larger geopolitical context and to the looming threat of Israeli and international coalition strikes. This strategic hesitation is allowing groups labeled as terrorist organizations to infiltrate Aleppo with little resistance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Damascus has been forced to acknowledge the worsening situation, announcing that it would be bolstering military supplies to strengthen its position. However, these efforts seem reactive rather than proactive, a sign that its military strategy is increasingly on the defensive.</p>
<p>The surprise insurgency casts serious doubts on the viability of the 2020 ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia and T&uuml;rkiye. It highlights the deal&rsquo;s fragility and, as the fighting intensifies, the region&rsquo;s stability hangs in the balance. International diplomacy&rsquo;s failure to bring about a lasting resolution in Syria is also evident. UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen&rsquo;s statement about a <em>&ldquo;political stalemate&rdquo;</em> echoes a broader global frustration over lack of progress. Efforts at conflict resolution have been stymied by inertia and competing interests, making permanent peace seem increasingly remote.</p>

<p>Regionally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s attempts to open dialogue with Syrian President Bashar Assad have also stalled. Erdogan has expressed a desire for normalization, which he claims would pave the way for peace in Syria. Yet, no significant steps have been taken toward this goal. T&uuml;rkiye, which has taken in over three million refugees from Syria, faces mounting pressure on both the human-displacement front and in its ongoing conflict with Kurdish groups. Any serious progress toward peace must involve dialogue between Ankara and Damascus &ndash; an element still missing from the current strategy.</p>
<p>T&uuml;rkiye has a growing military presence in Syria, with 12 bases and 114 military sites, including a significant concentration in Aleppo and Idlib. While Iranian forces remain larger in number, Ankara&rsquo;s military capabilities &ndash; particularly in air defense, artillery, and modern communications technology&mdash;make it an increasingly influential player in the Syrian conflict.</p>
<p>This shift in power dynamics has allowed T&uuml;rkiye to bolster its position in Syria, with an ability to control various armed groups under its patronage, though it does not officially acknowledge this. Through its actions, Ankara is consolidating its influence, particularly in Aleppo, where it is positioned to play a central role in the conflict&rsquo;s future trajectory.</p>
<p>The geopolitical struggle is intensifying. The Syrian conflict and, in particular, the battle for Aleppo reflects the broader struggle for influence between regional powers like T&uuml;rkiye and Iran. Ankara&rsquo;s military engagement in Syria is likely to continue to expand, as its influence becomes increasingly critical to the region&rsquo;s future stability.</p>

<p>Israel&rsquo;s longstanding concerns about the growing influence of Iran-backed forces near its borders have become more urgent as Syria&rsquo;s internal conflict drags on. In response, the Jewish state has positioned itself as a key player in shaping the regional security landscape, taking a more proactive stance to counter the expansion of Iranian influence.</p>
<p>This shift in Israeli strategy aligns with a broader US approach that is likely under the incoming Trump administration, which will prioritize countering Iran and strengthening ties with regional allies like Israel. With a potential re-engagement of a Republican-led administration, Israel&rsquo;s strategic interests and its close partnership with the US could drive coordinated actions in Syria, influencing both local and foreign actors.</p>
<p>Will the situation in Syria ultimately force a shift in regional power structures? Could T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s growing role signal the end of Iranian influence there? Also, as Aleppo becomes a battleground for broader geopolitical struggles, what role will Israel and the US play in the final outcome?</p>
<p>The battle for Aleppo is far from just another military clash &ndash; it&rsquo;s the focal point of a power struggle that involves not only Syria&rsquo;s fate but also the geopolitical future of the Middle East.</p>

                            <p><strong>Annalena Baerbock has reportedly said Berlin would support an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine “with all its strength”</strong></p>


            <p>Berlin will not rule out sending its troops to Ukraine to secure a ceasefire&nbsp;if a deal is reached between Moscow and Kiev, German media reported on Tuesday, citing Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.</p>
<p>According to Die Welt, during a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, Baerbock declared that&nbsp;Germany is willing to back any initiative promoting lasting peace in Ukraine <em>&ldquo;with all its strength.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>She suggested that a potential peace deal could include security guarantees for Kiev, such as the prospect of NATO membership and continued military support from the West, as well as an international peacekeeping mission.</p>
<p>Asked about what military role Germany could play in such a deal, Baerbock was quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) as saying that <em>&ldquo;only we as Europeans can protect peace together,&rdquo;</em> suggesting that EU countries, including Germany, could send their soldiers to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Recent media reports have suggested that France and the UK are also considering deploying their troops to the front line in Ukraine to ensure a ceasefire in the event that Moscow and Kiev engage in peace talks.</p>

<p>According to a high-ranking NATO official who spoke with the Ukrainian branch of the CIA-founded news outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, putting Western boots on the ground in Ukraine is seen as a way of ensuring that European NATO members have a say in the outcome of the conflict after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in in January.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Intelligence Service has reported that Western nations are planning to deploy as many as 100,000 <em>&ldquo;so-called peacekeepers&rdquo;</em> to Ukraine. The agency has warned that such a large force would amount to an occupation and effectively give Kiev time to rebuild its army before renewing hostilities with Russia.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also noted that Moscow has already repeatedly outlined <em>&ldquo;clear parameters&rdquo;</em> for a resolution of the Ukraine crisis. He said the core causes of the conflict, such as the continued expansion of NATO in Europe and Kiev&rsquo;s systematic violation of the rights of Russian-speaking citizens, need to be addressed in order to move towards a resolution.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deeper than sending in some peacekeepers,&rdquo;</em> Peskov said.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Elon Musk’s satellite internet service was used by individuals who trafficked meth into the country, a high-ranking officer said</strong></p>


            <p>Indian police will seek information from Starlink after smugglers allegedly used the satellite service provided by Elon Musk&rsquo;s company to bring $4.25 billion worth of methamphetamines into the country, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>Last week, security forces at India&rsquo;s Andaman and Nicobar islands discovered 6,000kg of meth on a boat, which had arrived from Myanmar, in the largest seizure of its kind to date. Six Myanmar nationals were detained over the suspected contraband.</p>
<p>The smugglers<em> "were using Starlink [for navigation] since their journey started from Myanmar,&rdquo;</em> Hargobinder S. Dhaliwal, a top police officer in the Andaman Islands, told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officer told the agency of his intention to contact Elon Musk&rsquo;s company and seek information about who bought the device and when, as well as about its usage history.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This [case] is different because it is bypassing all the legal channels. They directly operated [phones] with satellites, creating a Wi-Fi hotspot,&rdquo;</em> Dhaliwal explained.</p>

<p>Law enforcement authorities are now investigating whether any local or international criminal networks were involved in the meth smuggling ring. The probe will approach the case from all angles, the officer said.</p>
<p>Starlink has yet to comment on the incident. However, it previously said its coverage in territorial waters is contingent on government approval.</p>
<p>The smugglers were caught using Starlink as the US company is edging closer to launching in India.</p>
<p>Last month, Indian Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said Musk&rsquo;s firm was seeking security clearance to offer satellite broadband services in the country from New Delhi. <em>&ldquo;When you check all the boxes, you get the license. If [Starlink] do that, we will be very happy,&rdquo;</em> Scindia said.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Netherlands might find itself in a major conflict in the next five to ten years, according to a document from the defense ministry</strong></p>


            <p>The Dutch Defense Ministry is considering the possibility of reintroducing compulsory military service, 27 years after the practice was dropped in the country, RTL has reported.</p>
<p>The media network said on Tuesday that it had obtained a document from the ministry, detailing an action plan&nbsp;to reinstate&nbsp;conscription, on the grounds that the Netherlands could find itself in a major conflict in the next five to ten years, due to deteriorating global security.</p>
<p><em>"The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East and various other flash points have shown once again that security cannot be taken for granted,&rdquo;</em> the document stressed, as cited by RTL.</p>
<p>According to the article, the reintroduction of compulsory military service would be a lengthy and complicated process. However, if neigboring EU and NATO member states decide to reinstate the draft, the Netherlands will immediately follow suit, it said.</p>
<p>The outlet noted that Germany, France and Poland are currently considering bringing back conscription, at least partially.</p>
<p>When asked for comment by RTL, the Netherlands Chief of Defense, General Onno Eichelsheim, said compulsory military service <em>&ldquo;right now&hellip; is not on the agenda and is not necessary.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Eichelsheim described the document as <em>&ldquo;a theoretical exercise.&rdquo;</em> He pointed out that it would take years for the Dutch military to acquire the necessary equipment, build barracks and increase training capacity to accept such a large number of recruits.</p>
<p>RTL estimated that if the recruitment of 17-year-olds were to begin, the armed forces would have to accommodate and train up to 200,000 soldiers annually. However, according to the broadcaster, the military is currently capable of training up 1,000 draftees per year, with plans to increase the number to 9,000 by 2029.</p>
<p>The Netherlands currently has a professional army of just over 42,000 service personnel.</p>
<p>Technically, the draft still exists in the country for men aged from 17 to 45 and women from 17 to 23. Thousands of people receive conscription letters every year, but the requirement for them to actually report for military service has been suspended since 1997.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has been among the staunchest supporters of Ukraine since the start of the conflict with Russia, supplying hardware including Leopard 2 tanks and F-16 fighter jets. According to the Dutch government, military aid to Kiev will reach &euro;3 billion ($3.15 billion) this year, with the same sum earmarked for 2025.</p>

                            <p><strong>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has called Seoul “unpredictable” following the brief imposition of martial law</strong></p>


            <p>North Korea&rsquo;s concerns over its security are understandable given the political instability in the South, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said.</p>
<p>In a surprise televised address on Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol imposed emergency martial law, claiming that the opposition, which he accused of being sympathetic towards the North, had been preparing a <em>&ldquo;rebellion.&rdquo;</em> Within hours, 190 members of parliament, who managed to access the National Assembly despite military cordons, voted unanimously to lift the decree.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the head of state reversed his decision.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Zakharova said: <em>&ldquo;In my opinion, many have understood why the DPRK (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea)&hellip; is so concerned over its security.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because they see that in a couple of hours </em>[South Korea]<em> can morph from a professed democracy into absolute chaos, with tanks on the streets, a storming of parliament, popular confrontation and some brute-force tactics,&rdquo;</em> the official claimed.</p>
<p>According to the Russian diplomat, with such an <em>&ldquo;unpredictable&rdquo;</em> neighbor, North Korea&rsquo;s special focus on its security is entirely justified.</p>

<p>South Korean media quoted the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, as warning on Wednesday that President Yoon has <em>&ldquo;failed once and he will attempt again </em>[to declare martial law]<em>, but there is a greater risk than that.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The left-wing politician alleged that <em>&ldquo;there is a significant risk that he will provoke North Korea and disrupt the ceasefire line, leading to armed conflict.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Lee went on to suggest that the president would not hesitate to <em>&ldquo;sacrifice people&rsquo;s lives&rdquo;</em> to stay in office.</p>
<p>According to Yonhap news agency, 191 lawmakers representing the Democratic Party, along with five smaller parties, submitted a motion on Wednesday to impeach Yoon, with plans to put it to a vote on Friday or Saturday.</p>
<p>The Chosun newspaper reported that all members of the State Council, as well as several other senior government officials, tendered their resignations on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The political crisis in South Korea follows a parliamentary deadlock over next year&rsquo;s budget. The opposition had blocked President Yoon&rsquo;s bill and put forward its own, insisting on the need to increase public spending in order to <em>&ldquo;revive people&rsquo;s livelihoods and the economy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The head of state, who on Tuesday accused his political opponents of paralyzing the government with <em>&ldquo;anti-state activities,&rdquo;</em> has also been resisting calls for a probe into several scandals, involving his wife and senior officials.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Wild sturgeon is strictly protected in the country, with only farmed products allowed on the market</strong></p>


            <p>Two Russian citizens have been caught transporting some 260kg of sturgeon caviar and over 310kg of fish meat and are now being investigated for poaching, the country&rsquo;s Federal Security Service (FSB) reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>FSB border guards and local police in Khabarovsk Region and the Jewish Autonomous Area in Russia&rsquo;s Far East made the bust, the statement said. Officials released footage showing officers searching a car and laying out scores of packages containing the prized delicacy.</p>
<p>Depending on the sturgeon species, its salted roe can retail for between $475 and $1,140 per kg in Russia. However, only products from fish farms are allowed on the market.</p>
<p>The Caspian Sea is best known as the historic source of Russian caviar, but the Far East has some indigenous species of its own, such as the endangered Amur sturgeon, found in the river of the same name.</p>
<p>Police and border guards suspect the intercepted individuals of poaching, because they had no paperwork to prove the origin of their cargo. If found guilty, they could serve between five and eight years plus a hefty fine, or get a harsher sentence if investigators manage to prove an intention to sell.</p>

<p>Yumba urged the population to exercise caution, particularly by avoiding touching deceased individuals, to prevent further spread of the illness.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>A Kenyan middle-distance gold medallist has described Moscow as a “great sporting power”</strong></p>


            <p>Kenyan Olympic champion Wilfred Bungei has denounced the ban on Russia&rsquo;s national team from international sports competitions as shameful, demanding that it be lifted.</p>
<p>The retired middle-distance runner, who won the 800m gold medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, made the comments in an interview with TASS, published on Monday.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The fact that athletes from Russia were banned from participating in international competitions is a disgrace for the competition organizers. This ban must be lifted,&rdquo;</em> he told the news agency.</p>
<p>Russian and Belarusian athletes were stripped of their right to compete in the Olympics and other international sporting events under their countries&rsquo; flags following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. </p>
<p>For this year&rsquo;s Paris Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) set a maximum of 55 Russian athletes who could qualify, and 28 for Belarus. Athletes could only take part as neutrals and were limited to individual competitions, completely barring both nations from team sports. They were also excluded from the opening and closing ceremonies.</p>

<p>Speaking to TASS on the sidelines of the Russia-Kenya International Football Mums Cup, a women&rsquo;s tournament that he helped organize in the East African nation&rsquo;s capital, Nairobi, on Monday, Bungei referred to Russia as a <em>&ldquo;great sporting power.&rdquo;</em><br /><em></em></p>

                            <p><strong>Kim Yong-hyun has apologized for causing “confusion and concern” by advising President Yoon Suk Yeol to declare martial law</strong></p>


            <p>South Korean Minister of National Defense Kim Yong-hyun has announced that he is taking responsibility for the recent declaration of martial law in the country, and will be tendering his resignation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol unexpectedly declared martial law, citing a threat posed by <em>&ldquo;pro-North Korean forces,&rdquo;</em> and accusing the opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, of paralyzing the government with <em>&ldquo;anti-state activities.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Several hours later, however, the president announced that the state of emergency would be lifted after the parliament voted unanimously against the decision.</p>
<p>In a message shared with the media on Wednesday, Defense Minister Kim said he felt <em>&ldquo;responsible for all the turmoil caused by the emergency martial law,&rdquo;</em> and apologized for causing confusion and concern to the public.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I take responsibility for all matters related to martial law and have tendered my resignation to the president,&rdquo;</em> Kim said.</p>
<p>Kim is believed to have been the one who advised President Yoon Seok Yeol to declare martial law, according to Yonhap news agency.</p>
<p>In his message, Kim also emphasized that all the soldiers who had taken part in imposing the measures had been performing their duties and following the minister&rsquo;s instructions, adding that <em>&ldquo;all responsibility lies with me.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Martial law has been lifted and the people are returning to their daily lives, but the domestic political and security situations are not easy,&rdquo;</em> Kim noted, adding that the National Defense Ministry was taking the situation <em>&ldquo;very seriously.&rdquo;</em> He said it would take all necessary measures to resolve issues without disrupting national defense operations or undermining the country&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;firm military readiness posture.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The Democratic Party leader, Lee Jae-myung, had previously denounced the president&rsquo;s enactment of martial law as <em>&ldquo;unconstitutional,&rdquo;</em> and called on the military and police to resume their normal duties.</p>
<p>South Korean opposition parties have also submitted a motion to impeach President Yoon over the incident. The move would require the support of two-thirds of parliament and at least six justices of the country&rsquo;s nine-member Constitutional Court. The motion could be put to a vote as early as Friday.</p>
<p>President Yoon&rsquo;s approval rating has consistently declined in recent months, while the parliamentary opposition has repeatedly derailed his agenda. Last week, the Democratic Party also shot down Yoon&rsquo;s 2025 budget bill, and called for investigations into several scandals surrounding the president&rsquo;s wife and senior officials.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The canines that killed the EC president’s horse in 2022 will lose their protection from being hunted</strong></p>


            <p>The majority of EU nations have agreed to downgrade the protection offered to wolves from being hunted or captured, reflecting a personal win for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
<p>The head of the commission <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/562085-ursula-leyen-horse-wolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost</a> a 30-year-old pony named Dolly to a wolf attack in 2022. After the incident, von der Leyen allegedly waged a campaign to permit the resumption of wolf hunting, which European diplomats described as <em>&ldquo;strange,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;bizarre,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;puzzling,&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;pushy,&rdquo;</em> according to Politico.</p>
<p>The current &lsquo;strictly protected&rsquo; status prohibits the deliberate targeting of the predators, unless they pose a serious threat to livestock or humans. The lower grade, which will come into force next March, simply requires regulation to protect wolf populations.</p>
<p>The EU countries safeguard their fauna under the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, which has also been signed by several African countries and T&uuml;rkiye, among others. The vote to reduce the protection of wolves took place at a meeting in Strasbourg.</p>

<p>The European Commission proposed the measure in December 2023, citing estimates that the number of wolves in member states had grown from 11,193 in 2012 to 20,300 that year. They have been spotted in every EU country except Ireland, Cyprus and Malta, a report on the subject explained. The growing population was reportedly causing conflicts with local farming and hunting communities.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;The president of the European Commission is lobbying to rush a decision&rdquo;</em> on wolves, one source familiar with the matter complained in June, calling the pressure <em>&ldquo;very disruptive.&rdquo;</em> The EC, however, called von der Leyen&rsquo;s actions absolutely normal.</p>
<p>The expert explained that there was pressure to have EU ambassadors issue political guidance on the matter in March, before actual technical work started. This was a <em>&ldquo;peculiar&rdquo;</em> move for legislation concerning the protection status of a species, said a diplomat from a second EU country.</p>
<p><em>&rdquo;We need a balanced approach between the preservation of wildlife and the protection of our livelihoods,&rdquo;</em> von der Leyen said in a statement after the Tuesday vote.</p>
<p>Preservation groups have criticized the 2023 EU motion. The European Environmental Bureau, a network of more than 180 organizations, said that it went against the bloc&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;commitment to biodiversity protection and restoration.&rdquo;</em> It blamed the tensions on the fact that human communities had lost the skill of living next to wolves while their numbers were in decline.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Western sanctions meant to cripple the country’s economy have instead become an incentive to develop domestic industries, a report has found

 </strong></p>


            <p></p>
<p>Wages in Russia&rsquo;s industrial centers have shown double-digit growth over the past three years, outpacing energy-exporting regions which had long dominated income rises, according to Nezavisimaya Gazeta.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent studies by the Institute of National Economic Forecasting (INEF) of the Russian Academy of Sciences showed that since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, wages in industrial areas in Volga Region, the Urals, and Siberia have surged due to booming manufacturing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Udmurtian Republic and Kurgan Region, major machine-building hubs in Central Russia, have become <em>&ldquo;absolute leaders&rdquo;</em> in terms of wage growth with rises of 78% and 75% respectively since 2021, the outlet wrote on Monday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traditional energy-exporting regions have been lagging behind after Russian oil and gas sales to the EU shrank to about a tenth of their former level due to Western sanctions, the report said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skyrocketing earnings in Russia&rsquo;s industrial regions has prompted growth in other sectors such as retail and construction. Economists have attributed the growth to a complete reshaping of Russia&rsquo;s economy, which has marked a major recovery in industry.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, the Russian economy was largely focused on Western-bound energy exports, according to INEF professor Nadezhda Mikheeva. In previous decades, the population and production were concentrated around economic centers in oil and gas-extracting regions in Russia&rsquo;s North-West, Center, and South, she said. In contrast, the country&rsquo;s largest industrial centers had stagnated following the collapse of the Soviet Union.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Western sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy have instead become a powerful incentive for developing industries, Mikheeva noted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier this year, Russia&rsquo;s Economy Ministry said it expects real wages, or average wages adjusted for inflation, to grow by 9.2% in 2024 compared to an 8.2% increase in 2023. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2027, the average monthly salary in Russia will amount to 100,000 rubles (about $1,000, at present nominal values), the ministry predicted. At current IMF purchasing power parity conversion rates (28.38), this is equivalent to $3,523 in the US.</p>

                            <p><strong>The US president complained about the “selective prosecution” of his son while explaining his decision to grant him a ten-year pardon</strong></p>


            <p>Lawyers representing US President-elect Donald Trump have included excerpts from Joe Biden&rsquo;s statement on why he gave a ten-year sweeping pardon to his son Hunter in a motion to dismiss a case against their client in New York.</p>
<p>Last week, the outgoing president&nbsp;protected his son Hunter from federal prosecution for any crimes committed over a decade up to 2024.&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;claimed the prosecution of his son was unfair and instigated by his political opponents <em>&ldquo;to attack me and oppose my election.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Hunter had not been allowed a plea deal from the DoJ, and alleged that <em>&ldquo;raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a legal document filed on Monday, Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued that Biden&rsquo;s move served as an <em>&ldquo;extraordinary condemnation&rdquo;</em> of his own Department of Justice (DoJ). The federal government had a direct impact on his prosecution in the state of New York, they claimed.</p>
<p>The lawyers are asking Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan to toss a case involving hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during Trump&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign. New York District Attorney Alvin Brag secured a conviction in the case last May, which made Trump the first-ever former US president to be found guilty on felony charges.</p>
<p>After Trump&rsquo;s re-election last month, Merchan postponed the sentencing process indefinitely and allowed a new motion to dismiss to be filed. Blanche and Bove have accused Brag of targeting Trump for political reasons, saying he ran for elected office on a promise to keep going after the politician.</p>

<p>Critics of Trump have used his status as a convicted felon, as well as multiple other charges filed against him, to argue that he is unfit for office.

            <p>Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma was summoned by Dhaka on Tuesday over an attack on a Bangladeshi diplomatic mission in northeast India, near the countries&rsquo; shared border.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission in Agartala was attacked the previous day by a group of activists protesting against the <a href="https://www.rt.com/india/608215-india-questions-hindu-monks-arrest-bangladesh/">arrest of a Hindu monk</a> in Bangladesh last week. The incident further aggravated tensions over the treatment of the Hindu minority in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The Bangladeshi foreign ministry expressed <em>&ldquo;deep resentment&rdquo;</em> over the attack, noting that members of the mission were left <em>&ldquo;with a deep sense of insecurity.&rdquo;</em> India&rsquo;s Ministry of External Affairs described the incident as <em>&ldquo;deeply regrettable.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>New Delhi has been raising concerns over violence against the Hindu community, which is a minority in Bangladesh, ever since the change of government in the country in August. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who forged close ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government, resigned on August 5 following weeks of violent protests. The interim government, set up days after<a href="https://www.rt.com/india/602453-bangladesh-coup-us-revenge-hasina/"> Hasina&rsquo;s ouster</a>, is led by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist.</p>
<p>While Dhaka has not released an official statement on summoning the Indian envoy, Verma was seen entering the foreign ministry building for a meeting with acting Foreign Secretary Riaz Hamidullah, The Daily Star newspaper reported. It then quoted Shafiqul Alam, Yunus&rsquo; press secretary, as saying Dhaka had <em>&ldquo;issued a protest letter and conveyed our concerns&rdquo;</em> to the Indian side. He also said the attack was a result of Indian media spreading misinformation about minority issues in Bangladesh, the report added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yunus has previously <a href="https://www.rt.com/india/607856-bangladesh-interim-leader-seeks-extradition/">dismissed concerns</a> over violence against the Hindu minority, calling it <em>&ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo;</em> He said he conveyed the same message during his call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indian envoy, who spoke with local media after a meeting with the foreign secretary, said the wide-ranging relationship between the two nations <em>&ldquo;cannot be stuck on one issue.&rdquo;</em> He also stated that India wants to build a constant, stable, and constructive relationship with Bangladesh: <em>&ldquo;We are ready to engage with Bangladesh&rsquo;s interim government and are committed to working together to achieve our shared aspirations in peace, security, and development.&rdquo;</em></p>

            <p>American journalist Tucker Carlson has said the US government has been blocking his attempts to organize an interview with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky for more than a year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Carlson published a video on X in which he previewed the upcoming release of an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.</p>
<p>The journalist said the conversation with Russia&rsquo;s top diplomat was aimed at providing a perspective on how close Washington and Moscow could be to a direct clash, after the administration of outgoing US President Joe Biden granted Ukraine permission to fire American-made long-range weapons deep into Russian territory.</p>
<p>In the same clip, filmed on Manezhnaya Square in the heart of Moscow, the former Fox News host revealed that <em>&ldquo;we have also tried for over a year to get an interview with Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Carlson, his team <em>&ldquo;have attacked that from a bunch of different angles. We have spoken to a lot of different people around him, had dinner with them. We have been in talks continuously.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<br /><em></em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;And those efforts have been thwarted by the US government. The American Embassy in Kiev, which our tax dollars pay for, told the Zelensky government: No, you may not do the interview. You can talk to CNN. You cannot talk to us,&rdquo;</em> Carlson said.</p>
<p>In June, the journalist said he had agreed an interview with the Ukrainian leader. However, Zelensky&rsquo;s press-secretary, Sergey Nikiforov, swiftly rejected the claim, saying that <em>&ldquo;Tucker Carlson should check his sources in the FSB (Russia&rsquo;s Federal Security Service) more carefully.&rdquo;</em> Zelensky <em>&ldquo;has a completely different schedule, and Tucker Carlson is not on it,&rdquo;</em> Nikiforov stressed.</p>
<p>Carlson&rsquo;s latest trip to Moscow is his second since the escalation between Russia and Ukraine in early 2022. In February, he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the recording of their two-hour conversation getting 14 million views on YouTube and 185 million views on X in the first three days after its release.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>The Kremlin’s ban on LGBT propaganda should not have any impact on homosexuals’ private lives, Valery Fadeev has said</strong></p>


            <p>The head of Russia&rsquo;s Human Rights Council has said the&nbsp;state ban on LGBT propaganda has no bearing on private homosexual relationships, and that he hopes gay people have not been negatively affected.</p>
<p>In an interview with the news outlet RBC published on Tuesday, Valery Fadeev was&nbsp;asked whether he thought the Kremlin is interfering in citizens&rsquo; private lives.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Homosexual relationships and propagandizing those relationships are different things,&rdquo;</em> the human rights chief responded. <em>&ldquo;A homosexual relationship, that&rsquo;s private life. And no one interferes with that. Gays have always been around, in all times, more or less.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The State Duma did not ban personal relationships, it banned propaganda,&rdquo;</em> he stressed.</p>

<p>When asked whether gay people are affected by the ban, Fadeev replied that he thought not.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No. I hope the gays are still doing okay,&rdquo; </em>he said.</p>

<p>However, the wider LGBT movement is <em>&ldquo;a very damaging imported&rdquo;</em> threat to Russian society, Fadeev said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Russian media reported that police had raided three Moscow nightclubs on suspicion of <em>&ldquo;spreading LGBT propaganda.&rdquo;</em> According to the Interior Ministry, a number of weapons were seized at one of the clubs. The establishment was also found to have been selling illegal, presumably unlicensed, alcohol.</p>
<p>Moscow has been implementing stricter laws regarding LGBTQ information for more than a decade, first banning related propaganda among minors in 2013 and broadening the ban to cover adults in 2022. Soon after, the Russian Supreme Court outlawed the <em>&ldquo;international LGBT public movement&rdquo;</em> as an extremist organization.</p>]]>

                            <p><strong>Earlier this year, Gregor Formanek was deemed not fit to appear before the courts</strong></p>


            <p>German courts have opened the way for a 100-year-old alleged former concentration camp guard to stand trial, overturning an earlier lower court&rsquo;s decision that he was unfit to do so.</p>
<p>The suspect, identified as Gregor Formanek in the German media, was charged last year with complicity in the murder of more than 3,300 people while working in an SS guard battalion at the Sachsenhausen death camp during World War II.</p>
<p>An medical expert determined in February that the centenarian was unable to stand trial due to his physical and mental condition. A district court in Hanau then made the decision to not continue proceedings.</p>
<p>A higher regional court in Frankfurt on Tuesday found the expert&rsquo;s findings to have been insufficient, after a local prosecutor&rsquo;s office and several co-plaintiffs lodged complaints about the Hanau district court decision.</p>

<p>Frankfurt Attorney General Torsten Kunze welcomed the move, stressing the trial could be one of the last of its kind, underscoring its historical importance, German daily Frankfurter Rundschau wrote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under German law, anyone who worked at a Nazi concentration camp can be prosecuted as an accessory to the murders committed there. A landmark ruling in 2011 served as a legal precedent, when John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian guard at the Sobibor death camp was found guilty of complicity in the murder of 28,060 Jews.</p>

<p>Since then, several former workers of Nazi concentration camps have been found guilty in Germany.</p>
<p>Formanek was reportedly a member of an SS guard battalion at Sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1943 to 1945. Located just north of Berlin, the facility held more than 200,000 Soviet soldiers, Jews, gypsies and other prisoners between its construction in 1936, and when it was liberated by Soviet and Polish troops in 1945.</p>
<p>By varying accounts, between 40,000 and 100,000 inmates are estimated to have been killed by forced labor, starvation, execution and medical experiments at the camp.</p>]]>
