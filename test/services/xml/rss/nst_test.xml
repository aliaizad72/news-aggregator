    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KOTA KINABALU: Former Sabah Pakatan Harapan (PH) chairman Datuk Seri Christina Liew has urged party members to stay calm after the change of the coalition's state leadership.  <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2024/12/1142549/ex-sabah-ph-chairman-wants-move-aims-bigger-victory-state-polls">Liew</a>, the PKR Kota Kinabalu division chief, said they should be humble and continue to work diligently for the party. She said her loss was only by a slim margin of three votes.</p><p>The result led to the local-based party United Progressive Kinabalu Organisation (Upko) president Datuk Ewon Benedick helming the PH coalition last week. </p><p>Liew, who is also state Tourism, Culture and Environment minister, said the election result had created some confusion among members as PKR was one of the founders of  PH. She added that Sabah PKR respects the new leadership and should continue PKR's agenda.</p><p>"Whether people respect us or not, thinking that we are irrelevant already (following the election result) that's not important. We started from an opposition party, but we are not in the opposition now.</p><p>"I just want to advise PKR members throughout Sabah, division chiefs and supporters, to remain calm and that we continue working like what we did over the last 25 years.</p><p>"After 25 years, we set up the first PKR branch here. And then a few years later, we had PH. At the time when I was appointed as PH chairman, we were still in the opposition. </p><p>"We went through difficult times and challenges, but we held on strongly and were united," she told the media after celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of Jesselton Hotel here. </p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KUALA LUMPUR: A Thai man was arrested by police in the southern province of Krabi after he drove his pickup truck into his wife and her family outside a police station in Nakhon Si Thammarat on Nov 20.</p><p>Police apprehended the suspect on Dec 3 at his family home in Krabi. He was identified as 27-year-old Pinno Sisooksai, the local news portal Thaiger reported on Wednesday. </p><p>This led to the violent incident to gain public attention even though it happened two weeks ago.</p><p>Pinno was later charged with attempted murder under Section 288 of the Criminal Code. </p><p>If convicted, he could face life imprisonment, the death penalty, or a prison sentence of 15 to 20 years.</p><p>On Nov 20, his wife, 26 year old Lek, accompanied by her child and other family members, went to Tung Yai Police Station in Nakhon Si Thammarat to file a complaint against him.</p><p>Lek claimed she had been physically abused by Pinno and was worried for the safety of herself and her child, which led her to seek police assistance.</p><p>It is alleged that Pinno followed Lek in his pickup truck and arrived at the police station shortly after her. As Lek and her family members were getting out of their vehicle and preparing to enter the station, Pinno is said to have driven his pickup into them.</p><p>The health status of Lek and her family members was not disclosed in the report.</p><p>A journalist from Channel 8 interviewed Pinno's younger sister, who had visited him at the police station after his arrest. </p><p>The sister expressed dismay over the incident.</p><p>"I don't want to tell you anything. It's a personal issue. It's a matter within my family. He (Pinno) didn't flee. He came to Krabi to visit my ill grandfather. That's all."</p><p>When asked about the allegations that Pinno deliberately drove into the victims, the sister denied the claim.</p><p>"He didn't hit anyone. The road was slippery because of recent rain and the car slid along the road and hit them."</p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KUALA LUMPUR: BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, revised downward its annual average of US$76 per barrel for Brent crude in 2025, down from US$78 per barrel previously.</p><p>In a research note today, BMI said oil prices are expected to start 2025 at a slightly lower level than anticipated in August.</p><p>"Moreover, we had been working under the assumption of a Kamala Harris presidency in the US, and while a second Donald Trump term holds mixed meanings for oil prices, the impact is likely to be net-bearish versus Harris, at least over a six to 12-month horizon," it added.</p><p>BMI said Brent prices remained relatively range-bound over November and into December, closing between US$71.80 per barrel and US$75.5 per barrel after posting large swings earlier this year.</p><p>It added that the market seems to have entered somewhat of a holding pattern ahead of the key OPEC+ meeting on Dec 5 and Turmp's inauguration on Jan 20.</p><p>At the meeting, OPEC+ decided to extend the current cuts to March 2025 from December 2024 and also slow the pace at which cut barrels would be returned to the market.</p><p>"We had anticipated the extension and this was already factored into our forecasts, but the new, slower schedule translates into a further 263,000 barrel per day reduction in supply growth on an annual average basis next year.</p><p>"While this will narrow the expected glut, production growth will nevertheless exceed the expected growth in consumption by at least 450,000 barrels per day," BMI said.</p><p>BMI is currently forecasting oil demand to remain relatively well-supported, with 2025 growth staying broadly on par with 2024 levels.</p><p>However, it added that there were notable risks to the downside, including how Trump would approach tariffs once in office and the impact this has on economic activity, trade, inflation and the US dollar.</p><p>"We believe actual tariff measures will be more limited than his bellicose statements suggest, given that these likely represent a starting position for negotiations.</p><p>"Moreover, their implementation will likely be gradual to help manage the macroeconomic fallout and temper market volatility," it added.</p><p>Nevertheless, BMI said these tariff measures could impact oil prices via both weaker fundamentals and sentiment channels.</p><p>It said China, which is subject to a growing number of trade barriers globally, would be a primary target, and the US and China alone account for around 37 per cent of global oil consumption.</p><p>"Several other markets may also come into the firing line, including Mexico, Canada, Vietnam, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Italy and these account for a further 15 per cent.</p><p>"Any adverse impact on economic activity and trade flows would erode demand to at least some degree and, even if consumption is unaffected, tariff announcements could dent investor confidence in oil," it said.</p><p>BMI added that higher tariffs in the US could, when coupled with a rise in deportations and domestic tax cuts, lead to a re-emergence of inflationary pressures.</p><p>"While higher inflation may incentivise investment in Brent as an inflation hedge, to the extent that it pressures corporate profit margins and household budgets, it could also undercut physical oil demand at the margins," it said.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <strong>LETTERS: </strong>MALAYSIA ranks 12th globally for the frequency of flood events, a sobering reality that is impossible to ignore.</p><p>It is a wake-up call to step up our efforts to adapt to this growing threat before the costs, both economic and social, spiral beyond control.</p><p>Without adaptation efforts, flood-related losses could soar to as much as 4.1 per cent of GDP and drive unemployment up by 2.2 percentage points by 2030, according to the World Bank and Bank Negara Malaysia.</p><p>Yet, there is a good deal on the table. Flood adaptation measures come at a cost of about 0.2 per cent of annual GDP, or approximately RM1 billion a year.</p><p>Investing in these measures could slash the economic impact of floods by more than 40 per cent, reducing losses by 1.8 percentage points to 2.3 per cent of GDP. </p><p>So, who will take the lead in financing this urgent need for adaptation? This is where Islamic finance can rise to the challenge. </p><p>Islamic banks, for example, can offer a range of Syariah-compliant financing options. They include revolving credit lines, leasing, and equity financing to support companies undertaking ecosystem-based preventive measures, such as restoring wetlands, preserving mangroves and reforestation in addition to building structural protection infrastructure like flood walls, retention basins, drainage enlargements and flood warning systems.</p><p>These adaptation projects can also be financed using proceeds raised from issuing sukuk. There is room for the markets to innovate further. One idea could be linking sukuk payouts to predefined trigger events such as river water exceeding a critical level or total damages surpassing a financial threshold. </p><p>If such an event occurs during the sukuk's tenure, sukukholders could endow (waqf) part or all of their principal or returns, or both, which will be directed to the issuer such as governments to fund flood recovery and rebuilding efforts.</p><p>This ensures swift disbursement of funds when it matters most, reducing the delays often seen in traditional disaster relief financing.</p><p>Lastly, it goes without saying that making takaful accessible and affordable to low-income communities is essential, as they are often the most affected in the face of recurring floods. Without access to risk protection, these vulnerable groups are left exposed to devastating economic shocks in the aftermath.</p><p /><p> <strong>DR NAZRUL HAZIZI NOORDIN</strong></p><p>Assistant Professor,</p><p>Institute of Islamic Banking and Finance,</p><p>International Islamic University Malaysia</p><p /><p> <hr> </p><p> <strong>The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New Straits Times</strong></p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>LONDON: Scientists in the United Kingdom have created a world-first urine test which could indicate the first possible signs of lung cancer, reported German news agency (dpa).  </p><p /><p>Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK, with around 50,000 people diagnosed each year. Only 10 per cent of people survive for 10 years after a diagnosis of lung cancer.</p><p /><p>Figures from Cancer Research UK (CRUK), which funded the study, show that around 46 per cent of cases are diagnosed when a person has later-stage cancer and it is harder to treat.</p><p /><p>But researchers hope that early detection could mean that patients get treatments sooner, giving them a better chance of overcoming the disease.</p><p /><p>The pioneering test looks for so-called "zombie" cell proteins which could indicate a patient has lung cancer in its earliest stages.</p><p>It has been successfully tested on mice and scientists are hoping to start in humans soon.</p><p /><p>Scientists at the University of Cambridge's Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, and the Early Cancer Institute, looked at proteins excreted by senescent cells.</p><p /><p>These cells are often referred to as "zombie cells" because they are alive in the body but are unable to grow and divide.</p><p /><p>The cells cause tissue damage by reprogramming their immediate environment to help promote the emergence of cancer cells.</p><p /><p>Now, scientists have developed an injectable sensor that interacts with zombie cell proteins and releases an easily detectable compound into urine, which signals their presence.</p><p /><p>Researcher Professor Ljiljana Fruk told the PA news agency: "We know that before cancer emerges, there are changes in the affected tissues.</p><p /><p> </p><p /><p>"One of the changes is the accumulation of damaged cells that are not damaged enough to be removed, but enough to release signals that reprogramme the tissue and make it perfect for cancer development.</p><p /><p>"We identified a specific protein released by these cells in lung tissue and designed a probe that is cut into two pieces in its presence. The probe is composed of two parts and the smaller one is released into urine through kidneys.</p><p /><p>"Once in urine, this part of the probe is too small to be detected, but it can be made visible by adding a bit of silver solution to it – the same silver compound used in photography in the early days of analogue photos.</p><p /><p>"By monitoring the colour of urine after the injection of the probe, we can say if cells are present in lungs that would indicate the early signs of pathological changes that might lead to cancer."</p><p /><p>She added: "Ultimately, we wanted to develop a urine test that could help doctors identify signs of the early stages of cancer – potentially months or even years before noticeable symptoms appear."</p><p /><p>Scientists behind the study said they were keen to find a test which was a cheaper alternative to expensive scans.</p><p /><p>Fruk added: "We urgently need cost effective, easy to use and sensitive strategies for early detection of cancer, particularly within high risk groups or those in danger of cancer recurrence.</p><p /><p>"Urine tests such like this could be performed in hospital labs even in the absence of expensive imaging instruments and rely both on specific proteins which can be linked to particular tissue.</p><p /><p>"We worked on lung, but there are other proteins that will be present in other tissues undergoing changes."</p><p /><p>Experts are hoping to end the pre-clinical stages of clinical trials soon and assess the effectiveness of the test in humans.</p><p /><p>"We have proven that urine detection works in mice," Fruk said.</p><p /><p>"We now need to move to more pre-clinical validation, identification of specific proteins in other cancers – we are interested in breast, melanoma and pancreatic cancer – and then validate it in patients.</p><p /><p>"Of course, parallel to science we need to make sure that we have a kit in place which can be easily used by hospital lab technicians all over the world.</p><p /><p>"Lots of progress has been done in treatment of particular types of cancers, but we need more and we need to do it faster."</p><p /><p>Dr Iain Foulkes, CRUK's executive director of research and innovation, said: "Cancer Research UK has been at the heart of lung cancer progress for more than 50 years, with over half-a-million lives saved from lung cancer since the mid-1980s.</p><p /><p>"The announcement of this project being led by Professor Fruk is another example of our commitment to driving progress, so that more people can live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer."</p><p /><p>Patrick Kelly, CRUK's spokesperson for the East of England, said: "With Lung Cancer Awareness Month, we hope people will do what they can to show their support – whether that's backing our Smokefree UK campaign or donating to help our scientists make the next big breakthrough." – BERNAMA </p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KUALA BERANG: A top student sponsored by Petronas, who fell into a coma after suffering a brain aneurysm, is now showing encouraging signs of recovery and is able to interact with his family.</p><p /><p>Muhammad Amirul Nazmi Sam, 20, was diagnosed with a ruptured blood vessel after collapsing on Dec 18 last year, which led to his coma.</p><p /><p>His mother, Wan Murni Wan Ngah, 46, said that Amirul was on track to complete his A-levels at a private university in Kuala Lumpur last March, with plans to continue his studies at a university in the United Kingdom in June. </p><p /><p>However, health complications forced Amirul, the second of three siblings, to postpone his academic journey. </p><p /><p>Despite this, Amirul has shown remarkable progress following regular treatment.</p><p /><p>"Since mid-March, Amirul has started to open his eyes after nearly three months in a coma. He now recognises me and his siblings and can make physical movements.</p><p /><p>"Alhamdulillah, the continuous efforts to bring Amirul for treatment have finally paid off, and his development has changed significantly," she said.</p><p /><p>Wan Murni also said that the respiratory and feeding tubes had been removed, and Amirul was now able to eat and breathe normally. </p><p /><p>She said that while he was not yet fully recovered, he could signal with his fingers when asked questions and responded to family conversations.</p><p /><p>Amirul is currently undergoing follow-up treatment at Hulu Terengganu Hospital (HHT), with specialist appointments scheduled for this month.</p><p /><p>"I hope Amirul will fully recover as his rehabilitation process seems very positive, despite the challenges he faced with the ruptured blood vessel in his brain.</p><p /><p>"Alhamdulillah, Petronas, the staff at Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital (HSNZ) in Kuala Terengganu, HHT, and my siblings have been a great help in easing the burden during Amirul's health crisis," she added.</p><p /><p>In February, it was reported that the <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2024/02/1012125/top-student-now-bedridden-after-suffering-serious-injury">exceptional Petronas-sponsored student fell into a coma</a> after suffering brain injury, which has left him bedridden at home and delayed his plans to further his studies in the UK. </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KUALA LUMPUR: One analyst believes it is time for investors to get selective on the oil and gas stocks in the upstream segment with an expected softening in drilling rig demand and uncertainties in greenfield capital expenditure by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas).</p><p>Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd Research is recommending a focus on maintenance-driven sector companies such as Dialog Group Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd and Keyfield International Bhd.</p><p>Dialog is preferred given the recovery in the spot tank terminal markets and gradually improving prospects for further expansion in capacities under Pengerang Phase 3; as well as a turn-around in margins for its engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC), plant maintenance and specialist product businesses.</p><p>Kenanga Research believes Dayang is well-positioned due to its exposure to brownfield maintenance activities in the upstream sector, specifically in hook-up & commissioning and topside maintenance after the recent win in Pan Malaysia contract, with a larger contract value despite less work.</p><p>"Its earnings growth will also be boosted by its marine division, which benefits from the booming offshore support vessel (OSV) subsegment," it said.</p><p>For Keyfield, Kenanga Research said  strategic focus on the maintenance-driven OSV sub-segment positions it to capitalise on sustained demand and limited vessel supply.</p><p>The company's prudent fleet expansion, including the acquisition of the vessel Aulia in August 2024, aligns with its growth strategy.</p><p>Kenanga Research said Velesto Energy Bhd's guidance for weaker rig utilisation following HESS Corporation contract cancellations suggests a softening in drilling rig demand, though daily charter rates (DCR) remain healthy at US$90,000- 110,000/day.</p><p>"Additionally, greenfield capex by Petronas and other producers is unlikely to see material growth given ongoing Petronas-PETROS uncertainties, though we believe the downside has been priced into valuations," it said.</p><p>Kenanga Research believes the Malaysian OSV sector, particularly the accomodation work barge segment, remains bullish due to persistent vessel supply tightness from years of underinvestment.</p><p>Unlike the drilling market, the local OSV market benefits from a captive structure as the cabotage policy restricts foreign vessels, while Malaysia's requirements for younger fleets (currently allowing vessels age cap of 20 years for tenders (from the cap of 15 years earlier) add to the supply constraints.</p><p>With an average fleet age of 14 years, the sector is nearing a critical point for fleet renewal to sustain long-term operational efficiency.</p><p>"These dynamics, coupled with strong demand, position the OSV sector for continued growth and robust charter rates. If the demand sustains in the coming years, we might see a pick-up in demand for OSV newbuilds, which could potentially benefit Shin Yang Group Bhd which is not rated by the firm.</p><p>Kenanga Research maintains an "Overweight" call on upstream service providers and midstream players due to a favourable macro-outlook.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>JAKARTA: Indonesian fruit seller Budi was seeking better prospects when he signed up for an IT job in Cambodia. But he found himself detained in a heavily guarded compound where he was forced to carry out online scams.</p><p>"When I arrived there, I was told to read a script," Budi, not his real name, told AFP on condition of anonymity. "It turned out that we were asked to work as scammers." </p><p>The 26-year-old was put to work 14 hours a day in a site ringed by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards, he said. His days were punctuated by threats from his supervisors, and the nights were short. At the end of six weeks, he received just US$390 of the US$800 he was promised.</p><p>Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.</p><p>Many have been rescued and repatriated, but dozens still languish in scam compounds, forced to trawl social media sites and apps for victims.</p><p>Food stall worker Nanda, not her real name, said her husband flew to Thailand in mid-2022 after his employer went under, jumping at the chance to earn 20 million rupiah (US$1,265) a month in an IT job recommended by a friend.</p><p>But after arriving in Bangkok, a Malaysian agent whisked him across the border with five others to the Myanmar town of Hpa Lu, where he was forced to work at an online scam compound.</p><p /><p> </p><p /><p>The man was made to work shifts of more than 15 hours, facing punishments and verbal abuse for falling asleep on the job.</p><p>"He told me what he had experienced – he was electrocuted, and also beaten – but he didn't tell me in detail to stop me from thinking about it too much," said the 46-year-old.</p><p>She said her husband was sold and moved to another scamming operation earlier this year.</p><p>Like Budi, her husband was able to get word out about the conditions he was subjected to during the brief moments he was allowed to use his phone.</p><p>Phones are collected at the start of the work day, and call logs and messages screened by the scam operators.</p><p>But the furtive communications, sometimes in brief coded words, are often the only clues helping activist groups and authorities to locate the scam compounds for rescue operations.</p><p>Between 2020 and September this year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.</p><p>The government has identified at least 90 Indonesians still trapped in scam rings around Myanmar's Myawaddy area, said foreign ministry citizen protection director Judha Nugraha, adding the figure could be higher.</p><p>An Indonesian housewife whose husband remains trapped by a Myanmar online scamming syndicate said she has pleaded with officials to help but with little success. </p><p>"It's very inhumane, a job with the working condition of 16 to 20 hours, without pay... and always getting intimidation, punishment," said the 40-year-old housewife, who also requested anonymity.</p><p>Judha said, however, that Jakarta could only cooperate with local authorities and did not have the jurisdiction to carry out arrests abroad.</p><p>"There are various conditions... that will affect the speed of handling cases," he said, pointing to scam rings in Myawaddy where rescue and repatriation was further complicated by conflict in the region.</p><p>Cambodian authorities said they would crack down on such scam operators but also urged Indonesia and other countries to mount public awareness campaigns to inform citizens about the scams.</p><p>"Don't wait until there is a problem and point fingers at each other. That's not a solution at all," Chou Bun Eng, vice-chair of Cambodia's National Committee for Counter-Trafficking, told AFP.</p><p>The Cambodian government "won't let criminals work freely," she stressed.</p><p>"We won't let them (scam centres) spread," she added, saying that international cooperation is key to stopping the groups because "criminals are not ignorant – they move from one place to another after committing criminal activities."</p><p>AFP was unable to reach a junta spokesman, or a spokesman for the Karen National Army, a military-aligned militia that controls territory around Hpa Lu – close to Myawaddy, for comment.</p><p>United Nations officials have said those trapped by scam syndicates are experiencing a "living hell."</p><p>Victims have little option but to survive under duress, said Hanindha Kristy of NGO Beranda Migran, which regularly receives pleas for help from Indonesians tricked into scam rings. </p><p>"There is a modern slavery practice here, where they were recruited, tricked to work as scammers," she said.</p><p>Budi was able to escape after he was transferred to another scam ring in the Cambodian border town of Poipet.</p><p>While grateful for his escape, Budi, who is now working at a palm oil plantation, remains wracked by guilt over the fraud he had been forced to carry out.</p><p>"The guilt will be a lifelong feeling, because when we take away people's rightful belongings, it's like there's something stuck in my heart," he said.</p><p> </p><p /><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p /><p>PETALING JAYA: Lawyer Fahmi Abd Moin is no longer representing the parents of late six-year-old autistic boy Zayn Rayyan Abdul Matiin. </p><p /><p>Fahmi confirmed today that he had stopped representing Zaim Ikhwan Zahari and Ismanira Abdul Manaf, both 29, who are facing joint charges of child neglect for allegedly causing physical injury to their son.</p><p /><p>"Yes, I stopped acting for them on Dec 4. They asked me to stop representing them, but to be honest, I'm not sure why," Fahmi told the New Straits Times.</p><p /><p>This marks the second time the couple has changed legal representation. </p><p /><p>When Zaim and Ismanira were <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1062975/zayn-rayyans-parents-charged-boys-neglect-watch#google_vignette">first charged</a> in June, they were initially represented by Fahmi and Mahmud Jumaat, respectively. </p><p /><p>However, Zaim's father, Zahari Mohd Reba, later clarified that Mahmud was never officially appointed, and Zahari had <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1060494/zayn-rayyans-parents-under-tremendous-pressure-says-lawyer">personally chosen</a> Fahmi to represent his son and daughter-in-law. </p><p /><p>Today, the couple was represented by lawyers Haresh Mahadevan and Ramzaini Idris during proceedings before Sessions Court judge Dr Syahliza Warnoh. </p><p /><p>Haresh and Ramzaini told reporters that they were appointed by the couple yesterday and were unaware of why Fahmi was no longer representing them.</p><p /><p>Haresh also confirmed that the couple accepted the decision of the Attorney-General's Chambers (A-GC), which rejected their bid to drop the child neglect charges. </p><p /><p>"They both want to clear their names and are looking forward to the trial," Haresh said.</p><p /><p> </p><p /><p /><p>The lawyers are now reviewing the case documents and have requested two compact discs and a forensic report concerning samples taken from the boy's body. </p><p /><p>"The prosecution has yet to provide us with these, and we are awaiting them," Haresh added.</p><p /><p>Earlier in the proceedings, Deputy Public Prosecutor Raja Zaizul Faridah Raja Zaharudin informed the court that the prosecution would provide all relevant documents to the defence before the mention on Jan 10.</p><p /><p>The court today heard that the A-GC had <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/12/1144585/gc-rejects-parents-bid-drop-neglect-charges-zayn-rayyan-case">rejected</a> the couple's representation to have their joint child neglect charges dropped. </p><p /><p>They will now go on a 15-day trial to commence from Feb 3. </p><p /><p>The couple is currently out on a <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1063052/zayn-rayyans-parents-leave-court-after-kin-post-bail">RM10,000 bail</a> each. </p><p /><p>In June, they claimed trial to a joint <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1062975/zayn-rayyans-parents-charged-boys-neglect-watch#google_vignette">charge of neglect</a> which may have caused physical injury to their eldest son, 6. </p><p /><p>They pleaded not guilty to the alleged offence committed from 12pm on Dec 5 until 9.55pm on Dec 6 last year around the area of Jalan PJU 10/1 in Damansara Damai. </p><p /><p>The charge under Section 31 (1)(a) of the Child Act 2001 is punishable under Section 31(1) of the same Act read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.</p><p /><p>It carries a maximum fine of RM50,000 or jail not more than 20 years or both upon conviction. </p><p /><p>The court, shall, in addition to any punishment specified in subsection (1), order the person convicted of an offence to execute a bond with sureties to be of good behaviour for such period as the court thinks fit and to perform community service.</p><p /><p>Zayn Rayyan was said to have gone missing before his <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2023/12/987732/zayn-rayyan-killed-elsewhere-body-dumped-near-stream-nsttv">body was found</a> at a stream in Damansara Damai in December last year. </p><p /><p>His body was found about 200-metres from <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1057991/zayn-rayyans-parents-arrested">his home</a> by members of the public who participated in the search operation. </p><p /><p>He was confirmed to have been killed based on the autopsy conducted, which found injuries to his neck and body.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, the work on it will continue," Pankin said on the sidelines of the XVII Verona Eurasian Economic Forum in the UAE's emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah.</p><p>The discussions do not involve a common currency, he clarified.</p><p>"It is not euro, nor is it euro-BRICS or BRICS-euro," the deputy minister said.</p><p>Moreover, Pankin added, Trump's recent statements on the matter could not have influenced the decision-making process.</p><p>"That is definitely not the case. I think that the president-elect's statements will change in the future. Not once and not in one direction. Which was typical of his first term," the Russian diplomat said.</p><p>On Nov 30, Trump threatened the BRICS countries that he would impose 100 per cent duties on them if they did not abandon plans to create an alternative currency to the dollar. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier that it was too early to talk about the creation of a single BRICS currency.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Najib Razak told the High Court today that he has nothing to hide in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) financial scandal.</p><p /><p>The former prime minister maintained that he had been transparent about the millions of ringgit deposited into his AmIslamic account, which he consistently claimed were political donations from the Saudi royal family. </p><p /><p>"I would like to emphasise that I was transparent from the very beginning.</p><p /><p>"I was informed that I would be receiving funds as a donation from the late King Abdullah, and I immediately informed the then Ambank group managing director Cheah Tek Kuang about this when I opened the account, a step I was not obligated to take.</p><p /><p>"At that time, I was a textbook example of what is defined as a politically exposed person. </p><p /><p>"I also requested Cheah to inform Bank Negara Malaysia, which he did, notifying the then governor Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz," he said.</p><p /><p>The 71-year-old said this in his witness statement in his defence against all power abuse and money laundering charges involving RM2.3 billion of 1MDB funds.</p><p /><p>Najib said the funds were spent in accordance with the trust reposed on him by King Abdullah for political and corporate social responsibility.</p><p /><p>He said he meticulously recorded all of his expenditures by issuing cheques from the AmIslamic account to ensure transparency and proper documentation.</p><p /><p>The former Pekan member of Parliament said he was concerned over the clear evidence of collusion between former 1MDB top executives and fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho in the misappropriation of billions of ringgit from 1MDB. </p><p /><p>"It appears to be brushed aside, excused, or conveniently ignored.</p><p /><p>"To me, this feels deeply unsettling and personal, as it suggests that their primary role in this case is not to seek the truth, but to distort it, provide false testimony, and implicate me in what seems to be a politically motivated prosecution aimed solely at securing my conviction," he added. </p><p /><p>Najib faces four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount. </p><p /><p>The trial before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues. </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LONDON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he was appointing former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar," another step towards overhauling U.S. policy.</p><p>"He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.," Trump said in a post on his social-media site Truth Social, without saying whether "czar" was an official title.</p><p>The crypto czar and other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council.</p><p>Trump's tech backers generally want to see minimal regulation around artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, saying Washington would throttle growing innovative sectors with excessive rules.</p><p>Trump announced on Wednesday that he was nominating prominent Washington lawyer and crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, in a move celebrated by the industry.</p><p>Trump - who once labeled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin broke US$100,000 for the first time on Wednesday night, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets.</p><p>Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency asset manager Astronaut Capital, described the news as extremely bullish. "David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think," Dibb said.</p><p>Born in South Africa, Sacks, 52, is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal, a payment processing firm that was acquired by eBay in 2002.</p><p>Sacks is considered a member of the "PayPal Mafia" of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.</p><p>Musk, the Tesla CEO who leads artificial intelligence startup xAI, is a crypto fan and was appointed by Trump as co-lead of the new Department of Government Efficiency. The advisory board to streamline government is nicknamed DOGE, the name of a cryptocurrency.</p><p>Sacks is also a former chief executive of software company Zenefits and founded Yammer, a social network for enterprise users.</p><p>He was an early evangelist of cryptocurrencies, telling CNBC in a 2017 interview that he believed the rise of bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was revolutionizing the internet.</p><p>"It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralised web or the internet of money," he said.</p><p>Trump said Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KUALA LUMPUR: From an accountant to turning a tin wasteland into Sunway City, the fortune of Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah Fook Ling, founder and executive chairman of Sunway Bhd, has more than doubled over the past year, thanks to his majority stake in the diversified conglomerate.</p><p>Sunway's shares have steadily climbed this year, reaching a record high of RM5.02 on November 25, fuelled by its ambitious healthcare expansion plans, a robust 730-hectare landbank in Iskandar Puteri, and a solid construction order book.</p><p>Cheah's wealth has surged to US$2.4 billion, earning him the 8th spot on Malaysia's 50 Richest list by Forbes Asia, up 10 places from last year. The minimum net worth to qualify for the list rose to US$320 million from US$315 million in 2023.</p><p>At 79, Cheah has established a global business empire with 13 divisions operating across 50 locations.</p><p> </p><p>In Malaysia, his real estate ventures include Sunway City, a transformation of a former tin mine near Kuala Lumpur into a thriving ecosystem that serves as home, office, or classroom for 200,000 people. He replicated this success in Ipoh and is now expanding a third township in Iskandar Puteri, Johor.</p><p>Sunway's stock has surged significantly year-to-date, reflecting investor confidence in the company.</p><p>Despite Sunway's strong performance, Cheah has cashed out over RM1.55 billion in shares this year, according to an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The analyst said he is puzzled by the Cheah family's recent share disposals.</p><p>As of mid-January, the Cheah family held a 64.91 per cent equity interest in Sunway. Last month, Cheah reduced his direct and indirect stake in the company to 54.06 per cent.</p><p>Through his private vehicle, Sungei Way Corp Sdn Bhd, and personal holdings, he sold 100 million Sunway shares for RM485 million at RM4.85 per share via direct transactions on November 28.</p><p>Following the sale, his direct stake fell from 10.97 per cent to 9.98 per cent, while Sungei Way Corp's shareholding decreased from 45.41 per cent to 44.08 per cent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has been actively increasing its stake in Sunway, according to Bursa Malaysia filings.</p><p>On November 25, the EPF purchased 5.4 million shares, raising its stake to 6.49 per cent. Subsequent acquisitions lifted its holding to 7.64 per cent by November 28.</p><p>"Despite the share sales by Cheah, Sunway's strong financial performance and institutional interest underscore its potential for sustained growth," the analysts told Business Times.</p><p>For the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2024, Sunway reported a net profit of RM376.08 million, more than double the RM180.3 million recorded a year ago.</p><p>Revenue grew by 31.8 per cent to RM2.03 billion, compared to RM1.54 billion in the same period last year.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>JOHOR BAHRU: A 10-year-old boy from a children's home here has alleged physical abuse by a Sekolah Kebangsaan school teacher. </p><p>The alleged assault at the boy's school has left him with visible bruises and a blue black marks on his face. </p><p>The operation manager of the children's home where the boy resides had noticed the injury and reported the matter to the police at the Larkin station. </p><p>In the report, the manager claimed that the boy was involved in a disagreement with another fellow student at the school's computer lab, when a teacher suddenly confronted them. </p><p>The manager said the teacher allegedly slapped and punched the boy on the right cheek while trying to resolve the altercation.</p><p>"The boy suffered pain and bruises on his right cheek. I find it unacceptable for a teacher to behave in this manner towards a student," she said. </p><p>The incident sparked outrage on social media, with representatives from the home questioning the teacher's actions.</p><p>"Can a male teacher slap a child's face? When the child fell down, crying, he was punched again. Then his hair was pulled, and he was dragged to the office room. </p><p>"Is it because he has no parents that the teacher dared to do this? Or because he stays in a welfare home, does that mean he can be treated worse than an animal?</p><p>"This is not discipline. It is outright abuse," read a Facebook post shared by the children's home representative.</p><p>The representative added that while the boy may have been mischievous, any disciplinary action should have followed the Education Ministry's standard operating procedures.</p><p>"Caning is acceptable if done according to ministry guidelines. But this was a brutal assault, leaving the child with visible bruises on his face.</p><p>"We have filed a police report and leave it to the authorities to take appropriate action," the post continued.The home hopes the investigation will ensure justice for the boy and due accountability for the teacher's alleged misconduct.</p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KUALA LUMPUR: Harimau Malaya have named Dominic Tan, Syamer Kutty Abba and Syafiq Ahmad as co-captains for the Asean Cup, which kicks off on Sunday.</p><p>Speaking at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang before departing for Phnom Penh, Dominic said he was grateful for his appointment.</p><p>"I'm honoured to be given the co-captaincy. I'll take it with pride and do my best to lead the team," said the defender.</p><p>Malaysia will open their Group A campaign against Cambodia in Phnom Penh on Sunday.</p><p>Dominic is optimistic that the newcomers in the squad will make an impact during the tournament. Caretaker coach Pau Marti Vicente has named a mixed squad for the campaign, as some regular players are tied up with club commitments.</p><p>"We have many new faces, and I believe everyone here deserves to be part of this squad. We'll all give our best to achieve a good result in the competition.</p><p>"I'll do my best to help them perform at their best for the team.</p><p>"International matches are always tough, regardless of the opponent. Our focus will be on ourselves, and we'll go out there to get the results," Dominic added.</p><p>Syamer called his appointment as co-captain a huge honour.</p><p>"It's an honour to be one of the captains. It's good news, and I'll take it as a challenge.</p><p>"The responsibility of carrying the team is great, but we're a team, and we support one another," said the 27-year-old midfielder.</p><p>He also acknowledged the challenges of recovering between matches under the home-and-away format.</p><p>"The real challenge will be the tight schedule and recovery. </p><p>"We won't have time for training sessions with the players, so it's important to get as much out of each game," said Syamer.</p><p>Both players said they were surprised by the FA of Malaysia's (FAM) decision to part ways with Vicente and his coaching staff after the Asean Cup.</p><p>"Of course, it's not easy to hear that as a player. We've been working with Vicente for a long time, and he's been a fantastic coach.</p><p>"But people come and go, and we appreciate all he has done for the national team. We hope to give him a fitting farewell," said Dominic.</p><p>Syamer echoed these sentiments, saying: "Everyone knows Vicente has had a significant impact on the national team.</p><p>"We want to give him a parting gift during the tournament for all his contributions. This is the perfect stage for us to do so."</p><p>On Wednesday, Vicente confirmed via a statement from FAM that the Asean Cup would be his final assignment as caretaker coach of the senior national team.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>KUALA LUMPUR: Slow receding floods in some coastal areas of Terengganu remain a challenge for relief efforts, causing floodwaters to stagnate for prolonged periods. </p><p /><p>While the overall situation in the state is improving—with most river levels dropping below warning thresholds—districts like Kuala Nerus and Kulim Lusah continue to grapple with stranded animals, as seen on social media.</p><p /><p>Terengganu Fire and Rescue Department Assistant Director of Operations Muhammad Basri Kamarazaman said that stagnant floodwaters (banjir genang) typically occur in low-lying areas. </p><p /><p>"Coastal locations are particularly vulnerable, as rising sea levels combined with excessive rainfall often inundate these areas," he told the New Straits Times' Beyond the Headlines. </p><p /><p>Muhammad, however, noted that in most affected areas, relief centres are no longer at full capacity as displaced residents return home to begin cleanup works.</p><p /><p>"In Terengganu, many residents have proactively returned home to clean their homes as soon as the water recedes," he added.</p><p /><p>However, safety concerns remain a priority, especially when it comes to electrical hazards. </p><p /><p>"We've been advising residents through social media and village committees to ensure electrical switches and appliances are completely dry before use," Muhammad said.</p><p /><p>"Fire incidents tend to increase slightly after floods due to short circuits, making these reminders crucial to prevent sparks and potential fires."</p><p /><p>Looking ahead, heavy rains are forecast for Dec 8, raising concerns about a second wave of flooding.</p><p /><p>Muhammad assured that the Fire Department is prepared.</p><p /><p>"We operate under the united action command structure (arahan amalan bersatu), working closely with various agencies to manage the floods. Contributions from NGOs, statutory bodies, and private sectors, such as ECRL providing lorries, have been invaluable in recent recovery efforts."</p><p /><p>Post-disaster recovery is now the focus, with the military playing a key role under the State Disaster Management Committee, coordinating resources at the district level.</p><p /><p>"Deployment decisions are made during district-level disaster management meetings," Muhammad said.</p><p /><p>"For instance, during the recent floods, school relocations were managed efficiently through coordinated efforts involving the police and military."</p><p /><p>Muhammad added that convincing some residents to evacuate early can be challenging, as concerns over belongings often make them reluctant to leave.</p><p /><p>"We try to persuade them, but if they refuse, the police may need to step in," he said.</p><p /><p>Despite this, he commended the proactive response from the majority of residents, saying that only 1.4 per cent of cases required evacuation assistance.</p><p /><p>"This demonstrates a commendable initiative among residents to move early. I urge everyone to continue this practice, as early relocation helps prevent critical situations and ensures safety for all."</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>PETALING JAYA: The Attorney-General's Chambers (A-GC) has rejected the representation submitted by the parents of late autistic boy Zayn Rayyan Abdul Matiin, who had sought to have the joint child neglect charges against them withdrawn.</p><p /><p>Sessions Court judge Dr Syahliza Warnoh was today informed of the dismissal by deputy public prosecutor Raja Zaizul Faridah Raja Zaharudin.</p><p /><p>"We referred the representation letter filed by the previous lawyer of the accused to the A-GC, and it has been rejected. The new lawyers have been informed," she said.</p><p /><p>"We will proceed with the trial," she added.</p><p /><p>The parents of Zayn Rayyan, Zaim Ikhwan Zahari and Ismanira Abdul Manaf, 29, appeared calm and composed in the dock, dressed in all-black outfits.</p><p /><p>Their representation was submitted to the A-GC on Nov 19 by their previous lawyer, Fahmi Abd Moin.</p><p /><p>Raja Zaizul Faridah requested that the court set another mention date to allow the prosecution to update all necessary documents before the trial begins.</p><p /><p>She proposed Jan 10 for the mention, which was mutually agreed upon by both the prosecution and the defence.</p><p /><p>Raja Zaizul Faridah said that there were compact discs (CDs) still with the Forensic Department that had yet to be provided to the defence.</p><p /><p>The couple's lawyer, Haresh Mahadevan, informed the court that, in addition to the CDs, they had not yet received a forensic report.</p><p /><p>"This forensic report is linked to the post-mortem report, which includes samples taken from the boy's body for analysis. We request that this report be provided to us," he said.</p><p /><p>In response, Raja Zaizul Faridah assured the court that the prosecution would hand over all relevant documents to the defence before Jan 10, which would be used during the trial.</p><p /><p>During the proceedings, Haresh also requested the court to vacate a set of trial dates in January, which had previously been scheduled, as they had other proceedings in Negri Sembilan.</p><p /><p>The court agreed to Jan 10 for mention and ordered the prosecution to handover all documents to the defence before the said date. </p><p /><p>The judge set a 15-day trial to begin from Feb 3 to 7; Feb 17 to 21; and March 10 to 14. </p><p /><p>The prosecution plans to call 15 witnesses to testify. </p><p /><p>The couple is currently out on a RM10,000 <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1063052/zayn-rayyans-parents-leave-court-after-kin-post-bail">bail</a> each. </p><p /><p>In June, they claimed trial to a <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1062975/zayn-rayyans-parents-charged-boys-neglect-watch">joint charge of neglect</a> which may have caused physical injury to their eldest son,6. </p><p /><p>They pleaded not guilty to the alleged offence committed from 12pm on Dec 5 until about 9.55pm on Dec 6 last year around the area of Jalan PJU 10/1 in Damansara Damai. </p><p /><p>The charge under Section 31 (1)(a) of the Child Act 2001 is punishable under Section 31(1) of the same Act read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.</p><p /><p>It carries a maximum fine of RM50,000 or jail not more than 20 years or both upon conviction. </p><p /><p>The court, shall, in addition to any punishment specified in subsection (1), order the person convicted of an offence to execute a bond with sureties to be of good behaviour for such period as the court thinks fit and to perform community service.</p><p /><p>Zayn Rayyan was said to have gone missing before <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2023/12/987732/zayn-rayyan-killed-elsewhere-body-dumped-near-stream-nsttv">his body was found</a> at a stream in Damansara Damai in December last year. </p><p /><p>His body was found about 200-metres from his home by members of the public who participated in the <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2024/06/1057991/zayn-rayyans-parents-arrested">search operation</a>. </p><p /><p>He was confirmed to have been killed based on the autopsy conducted, which found injuries to his neck and body.</p><p /><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p /><p>MIAMI: Cameron Young fired a bogey-free 64, eight-under par, to seize a two-stroke lead after Thursday's opening round of the Tiger Woods-hosted Hero World Challenge golf tournament.</p><p /><p>The 27-year-old American, the 2022 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year who has yet to win a PGA title, sank eight birdie putts to grab the lead in the 20-player unofficial invitational event at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas.</p><p /><p>Two-time major winner Justin Thomas birdied four of the last five holes to shoot 66 to stand second while US compatriots Akshay Bhatia, Patrick Cantlay, Sahith Theegala and top-ranked defending champion Scottie Scheffler were joined by Sweden's Ludvig Aberg in a third-place pack on 67.</p><p /><p>World number 38 Young, who fired a 59 in the third round of the Travelers Championship last June, has seven PGA Tour runner-up finishes, including at the British Open in 2022.</p><p /><p>In his first start since August, Young sank birdie putt from 21 feet at the par-3 second, 13 feet at the par-5 third, 10 feet at the fourth, just inside six feet at the seventh and 16 feet at the par-3 eighth for a sizzling start.</p><p /><p>"It's a nice thing to come out and just feel like yourself," Young said. "Really happy with it. I feel like with the driver I was just really comfortable and that's a huge key out here. I drove it great.</p><p /><p>"I'm sure I missed a fairway or two, but for the most part I was really well in position. Then I made a couple putts early, which was nice. Just kind of got off to a nice start with the putter."</p><p /><p>Young added to it with tap-in birdie putts at the par-5 11th and 15th holes and a 14-foot birdie putt at the par-3 17th.</p><p /><p>"There's a bunch of par-5s and a couple drivable holes, so I feel that if you're on top of it, especially off the tee, you can make a bunch of birdies," Young said.</p><p /><p>The long layoff gave Young time to work on his game.</p><p /><p>"Just some work on myself physically and then just standard practice," he said. "It's a nice time to go back to all the really simple things and make them comfortable again, getting yourself really square, working on setup things."</p><p /><p>Sharing eighth on 68 were Scotland's Robert MacIntyre and Americans Sam Burns, Nick Dunlap and Keegan Bradley. — AFP</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>NEW YORK: A police manhunt was underway yesterday in New York for the suspect who killed UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson in a targeted attack outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday morning before fleeing into Central Park.</p><p /><p>Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit, was gunned down from behind in what police described as a targeted attack by a masked assailant lying in wait. It came just before the company's annual investor conference at the Hilton on Sixth Avenue.</p><p /><p>The words "deny," "defend" and "depose" were carved into shell casings found at the scene, police sources told ABC and the New York Post. </p><p /><p>A New York City Police Department spokesperson would not comment on the report.</p><p /><p>The words evoke the title of a book critical of the insurance industry published in 2010 titled "Delay Deny Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It." The author, Jay Feinman, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University Law School, wrote, "Sorry, no comment" in an email when contacted by Reuters.</p><p /><p>Authorities released a new photo with a clear view of the suspect's face yesterday, a day after publishing photos that showed his face partially obscured by a ski mask, and have asked the public's help in locating him. </p><p /><p>Police have also searched a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side where the suspect is believed to have been staying, CNN reported.</p><p /><p>Police have not publicly identified a motive, but Thompson appears to have been deliberately targeted, according to investigators.</p><p /><p>Security video showed the shooter behind Thompson, 50, raising his handgun and firing at his back. Police said the gunman arrived outside the hotel several minutes before Thompson and waited for him to walk past before firing, ignoring other passers-by.</p><p /><p>The suspect, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and the ski mask and wearing a gray backpack, fled on foot before mounting an electric bike and riding into Central Park, police said.</p><p /><p>Police published a number of images of the suspect taken from video cameras in the area, including one with the gun raised and pointed toward Thompson and another of the suspect fleeing on the bike.</p><p /><p>The city has the one of the most advanced surveillance systems of any major US city, largely built after the Sept 11, 2001 attacks, said Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD detective sergeant who is now an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p><p /><p>There are thousands of cameras in New York and all feeds can be monitored in real time as well as reviewed for previous footage, aided by facial recognition software.</p><p /><p>"It's called the real-time crime centre: actionable intelligence can be relayed to the responding officers in the field," Rodriguez said.</p><p /><p><b>'EXTRAORDINARY PERSON'</b></p><p /><p>UnitedHealth is the largest US health insurer, providing benefits to tens of millions of Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country.</p><p /><p> Thompson, a father of two, joined UnitedHealth in 2004 and became the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, in April 2021.</p><p /><p>The company has been grappling with the fallout from a massive data hack of its Change Healthcare unit that provides technology for US healthcare providers, disrupting medical care for patients and reimbursement to doctors for months.</p><p /><p>"Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him," the company said in a statement.</p><p /><p>In a video sent to employees on Wednesday, UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty announced Thompson's death, calling him a "truly extraordinary person." At its headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota, the company lowered flags on campus to half-staff, a spokesperson told Reuters.</p><p /><p>Thompson's wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that he had been receiving threats related to his job but said she did not know the details.</p><p /><p>"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives," she said later in a statement. "Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed."</p><p /><p>Police in Maple Grove, Minnesota, where Thompson lived, said there were no reports of threats to Thompson, but one reported incident of  "suspicious activity" at his home in June 2018.</p><p /><p>Paulette Thompson told police she was getting ready for bed when she reported seeing the deadbolt turning on their front door. Police found no sign of an attempted break-in and no one on the property. — REUTERS</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>SEOUL: South Korea's ruling party chief demanded Friday that President Yoon Suk Yeol stand down over his martial law attempt, warning he posed a great danger to the country.</p><p /><p>The stunning comments from Han Dong-hoon, the head of Yoon's People Power Party, almost guarantees enough lawmakers will vote to impeach the president on Saturday.</p><p /><p>Han's comments were a U-turn from Thursday, when he said he would block the impeachment, and another party leader insisted all 108 members of the PPP would unite to support Yoon in Saturday's vote.</p><p /><p>But Han said Friday that Yoon's refusal to acknowledge he had done anything wrong in declaring martial law on Tuesday night had prompted his change of position.</p><p /><p>"Considering the newly emerging facts, I believe that a swift suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol's duties is necessary to safeguard the Republic of Korea and its people," Han said.</p><p /><p>Han said Yoon had not taken any personnel actions against military officials who had "illegally intervened."</p><p /><p>"Furthermore, he does not acknowledge that this illegal martial law is wrong," he said.</p><p /><p>"Therefore, if President Yoon continues to hold the office of the presidency, there is a significant risk that extreme actions similar to the current state of emergency could be repeated, which could put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger."</p><p /><p>Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama.</p><p /><p>Seoul's allies were alarmed – Washington said it found out via television – and the opposition quickly filed an impeachment motion saying Yoon "gravely violated the constitution and the law." A vote is set for Saturday at around 7:00 pm (1000 GMT).</p><p /><p>The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member legislature and requires only a handful of defections from the PPP to secure the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment.</p><p /><p>According to a poll issued Thursday by Realmeter, 73.6 percent of respondents supported the impeachment. </p><p>Thousands of protesters continued to rally in central Seoul and near the parliament on Thursday evening demanding the president step down.</p><p /><p>If the impeachment motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must take place within 60 days.</p><p /><p>Yoon, who has lurched from crisis to crisis since taking office in 2022, has not been seen in public since his televised address in the early hours of Wednesday.</p><p /><p>On Thursday, his office said that Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun had resigned, but other key allies, including Interior Minister Lee Sang-min, remain in office.</p><p /><p>Prosecutors have also banned Kim from leaving the country, Yonhap news agency reported.</p><p /><p>Lawmakers on Thursday grilled senior figures, including army chief of staff General Park An-su, who acted as Yoon's martial law commander.</p><p /><p>Park said he was kept in the dark until after the president had announced the imposition of martial law on live television late Tuesday.</p><p /><p>It was the first such declaration in more than four decades in South Korea and brought back painful memories of its autocratic past.</p><p /><p>The move was to "safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness," Yoon said.</p><p /><p>Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building.</p><p /><p>But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers. Enough MPs got inside and voted down Yoon's move.</p><p /><p>Lawmakers formally presented the impeachment motion in the early hours of Thursday, saying Yoon's decision to impose martial law was intended to "evade imminent investigations... into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family."  </p><p /><p>"This is an unforgivable crime – one that cannot, should not and will not be pardoned," MP Kim Seung-won said. — AFP</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>NEW YORK: Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit, was fatally shot in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday morning in what police described as a targeted attack by a masked assailant lying in wait just before the parent company's annual investor conference at a Hilton Hotel.</p><p>Thompson, 50, had been with the company for 20 years and was CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the large insurance unit of UnitedHealth Group, since April 2021. The following is what you need to know about UnitedHealthcare:</p><p /><p> <strong>WHAT IS UNITEDHEALTHCARE'S BUSINESS?</strong></p><p>UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the US, providing benefits to more than 50 million Americans. The company offers benefit plans that cover much of routine healthcare, as well as care for customers who fall ill or sustain injuries. The unit had US$281.4 billion in revenue in 2023, nearly double that of the next largest US health insurer. Americans consistently pay more for healthcare than people in any other country.</p><p /><p> <strong>HOW DOES IT FIT INTO UNITEDHEALTH GROUP?</strong></p><p>UnitedHealth Group is a US$560 billion health conglomerate consisting of two main subsidiaries. In addition to the insurance business led by Thompson, there is Optum, which includes a pharmacy benefits manager, specialty pharmacy, data analytics, and doctor and surgical practices.</p><p>It also includes the technology company Change, which was the target of a cyber attack this year that affected thousands of providers and millions of healthcare customers.</p><p /><p> </p><p /><p>The entire company brought in US$371.6 billion in revenue last year and employed over 440,000 people at the end of 2023. Sir Andrew Witty became CEO of UnitedHealth Group in 2021 after previously running Optum. He had been CEO of the UK-based pharmaceutical company GSK from 2008 to 2017.</p><p /><p> <strong>HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES UNITEDHEALTHCARE COVER AND WHERE?</strong></p><p>At the end of the third quarter, the company provided health insurance for more than 50.6 million people, including 49.3 million in the United States. Nearly 30 million are enrolled in employer-based or other commercial insurance, 15.3 million in government-backed Medicare plans primarily for those aged 65 and older under Medicare Advantage programmes, and 4.3 million in Medicaid plans for low-income individuals. The company's global business provides benefits to customers in over 150 other countries, according to its annual report.</p><p>Under Thompson, UnitedHealthcare increased the number of people it covers domestically, rising from around 44 million when he became CEO in April 2021.</p><p /><p> <strong>HOW PROFITABLE IS IT?</strong></p><p>In 2023, the insurance business earned US$16.4 billion, up nearly a third from 2020, the year before Thompson took over as CEO.</p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Ridley Scott's "Gladiator II" and Disney's "Moana 2" to the upcoming "Scream 7" with Neve Campbell and "Freakier Friday" with Lindsay Lohan, Hollywood is banking on movie sequels.</p><p>It's a trend that's filling theatre coffers, and which shows no sign of slowing in 2025.</p><p>Sequels to cult movies continue to captivate audiences and score success at the box office.</p><p>The exceptional US box-office grosses over Thanksgiving weekend for "Moana 2" and "Gladiator II" bear witness to the moviegoers' enthusiasm for these sequels to successful films.</p><p>These impressive figures only confirm a growing trend: moviegoers are eager to return to their favorite universes and continue a cinematic experience that initially enthralled them.</p><p>Hollywood studios are well aware of this, and are increasingly relying on these tried-and-tested franchises to draw crowds to theatres.</p><p>And there are plenty of examples of this working successfully. "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice," directed by Tim Burton, like its predecessor, has been a big hit.</p><p>The film, which follows on from the original, released in 1988, has been acclaimed by a wide audience.</p><p>"Beetlejuice 2" grossed $447 million at the global box office, reflecting viewers' interest in sequels.</p><p><b>Reviving the hit movie franchises of the 2000s</b></p><p>Several sequels to cult movies have already been announced and are planned for the coming years.</p><p>Among them, sequels to the films of the 2000s are particularly noteworthy, including "Scream 7," which sees the return of Neve Campbell.</p><p>The saga's cult actress has decided to return to the project, despite salary-related issues, following Jenna Ortega's exit.</p><p>Meanwhile, "Freakier Friday," starring Lindsay Lohan, is a sequel to the popular 2003 comedy "Freaky Friday," and is eagerly awaited by fans.</p><p>The cult actress of the 2000s will once again share the screen with Jamie Lee Curtis and Chad Michael Murray when the movie hits US theatres on August 9, 2025.</p><p>Renée Zellweger will reprise her role as Bridget Jones, alongside "One Day" star Leo Woodall and Hugh Grant.</p><p>The comedy is the fourth installment in the "Bridget Jones" franchise, and is scheduled for release in February 2025.</p><p>According to forecasts by research institute National Research Group, the holiday season is set to be a busy one in theatres. "Sonic 3" is expected to gross more than "Mufasa," the prequel to "The Lion King."</p><p>The little blue hedgehog's third big-screen adventure could open with grosses of $55 million during its first weekend from December 20 to 22, compared to $50 million for Disney's animated film.</p><p>This demonstrates the public's appetite for these well-established franchises, whether they are chronological sequels or not. "Sonic The Hedgehog 3" and "Mufasa: The Lion King" are both slated for December 20 release in the US.</p><p><b>Movies that won't be getting sequels</b></p><p>For fans and creators of hit movies, sequels are always a double-edged sword, laced with the fear of failing to live up to expectations.</p><p>As a result, not all sequels see the light of day. A case in point is the planned sequel to "Notting Hill," starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, which has now been scrapped.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, screenwriter Richard Curtis said the idea had been shelved due to creative differences after proposing a divorce between the characters played by Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.</p><p>Despite his sequel to "Beetlejuice," Tim Burton said at the Marrakech International Film Festival that he would not be doing the same for "Edward Scissorhands."</p><p>"I didn't want to make a sequel to that because it felt like a one-off thing. I didn't want to have a sequel for 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' because it also felt like a one-off thing. Certain things are best left on their own, and that, for me, is one of them."</p><p>All eyes are already on the eagerly-awaited sequels to "Dune," "The Hunger Games" and "Wicked," which are generating excitement among a young and coveted audience.</p><p>These films could indeed help fill movie theatres once again.</p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p /><p>JERUSALEM: Amnesty International accused Israel yesterday of "committing genocide" against Palestinians in Gaza since the start of the war last year, saying its new report was a "wake-up call" for the world.</p><p>The London-based human rights group said its findings were based on satellite images documenting devastation, fieldwork and ground reports from Gazans as well as "dehumanising and genocidal statements by Israeli government and military officials."</p><p>Israel angrily dismissed the findings as "entirely false", denouncing the report as "fabricated" and "based on lies."</p><p>Amnesty's Israel branch said it was not involved in the report and "does not accept" the allegation of genocide.</p><p>Amnesty chief Agnes Callamard accused Israel of treating the Palestinians in Gaza "as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them."</p><p>"Our damning findings must serve as a wake-up call to the international community: this is genocide. It must stop now," she said in a statement.</p><p>Palestinian group Hamas, which has been fighting Israel in Gaza, welcomed the report as a "message to the international community... on the need to act to bring an end to this genocide."</p><p>The group's unprecedented Oct 7, 2023 attack which triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.</p><p>Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,580 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable.</p><p>Independent UN human rights experts have accused Israel of genocide several times, and South Africa brought a case against Israel to the UN's top court in December 2023 accusing it of "violating the genocide convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza." The case is still ongoing.</p><p>But Israeli officials have repeatedly and forcefully denied all such allegations, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields.</p><p>"The deplorable and fanatical organisation Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated report that is entirely false and based on lies," the Israeli foreign ministry said.</p><p>"Israel is defending itself... acting fully in accordance with international law."</p><p /><p> </p><p /><p>But Callamard insisted at a press conference in The Hague that "the existence of military objectives does not negate the possibility of a genocidal intent."</p><p>She said Amnesty had based its findings on the criteria set out in the UN Convention on the Prevention of Genocide.</p><p>But an Israeli army spokesperson said the report's findings "fail to account for the operational realities" it has faced.</p><p>"The (military) takes all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians during operations. These include providing advance warnings to civilians in combat zones whenever feasible and facilitating safe movement to designated areas."</p><p>While Amnesty Israel rejected the accusation of genocide, it said it was "concerned that serious crimes are being committed in Gaza" and called for an investigation and an immediate halt to the war.</p><p>Amnesty International said it "deeply regrets that some members" of its Israel branch "have chosen to distance themselves" from the report.</p><p>"Amnesty International stands by its rigorous research and conclusions," a spokesperson said.</p><p>Amnesty's 300-page report points to "direct deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructures where there was no Hamas presence or any other military objectives" as well as the blocking of aid deliveries, and the displacement of 90 percent of Gaza's 2.4 million people.</p><p>Palestinians have been subjected to "malnutrition, hunger and diseases" and exposed to a "slow, calculated death", Amnesty said.</p><p>The rights group, which is also due to publish a report on the crimes committed by Hamas, cited 15 air strikes in Gaza between Oct 7, 2023 and April 20, which killed 334 civilians, including 141 children, for which the group found "no evidence that any of these strikes were directed at a military objective."</p><p>The Amnesty report also referenced dozens of calls by Israeli officials and soldiers for the annihilation, destruction, burning or "erasure" of Gaza.</p><p>Such statements highlighted "systemic impunity" as well as "an environment that emboldens... such behaviour."</p><p>"Governments must stop pretending that they are powerless to terminate Israel's occupation, to end apartheid and to stop the genocide in Gaza," Callamard said.</p><p>"States that transfer arms to Israel violate their obligations to prevent genocide under the convention and are at risk of becoming complicit."</p><p> </p><p>© New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd</p>]]></content:encoded>
