<p>SIBU (Dec 6): Former Bukit Assek assemblywoman Irene Chang has urged the Sibu Hospital to reconsider going completely cashless.</p>
<p>She said the move to go cashless for an integral public service should not be implemented hastily, as a significant portion of the population is not ready to embrace a fully-cashless system.</p>
<p>“A hybrid system which accommodates both cash and card payments would better serve the diverse needs of the community.</p>
<p>“Inclusivity and accessibility should remain the cornerstone of public healthcare services,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chang said while this initiative aligns with broader digitalisation efforts, the Sibu Hospital’s board of management must consider and take into account potential negative implications it may have on the central Sarawak community.</p>
<p>“Sibu Hospital serves the whole central region of Sarawak and a significant portion of its patient population includes rural residents, senior citizens and the lower-income group.</p>
<p>“These individuals may not own debit or credit cards, and many of them live on a day-to-day basis and rely heavily on cash for daily transactions.</p>
<p>“This cashless policy risks alienating those who are already disadvantaged, including but not limited to the stateless community – who do not even have the necessary documentation to set up bank accounts, let alone debit or credit cards – or individuals whose (bank) accounts are frozen for reasons such as legal proceedings or bankruptcy,” she said.</p>
<p>She said in the event of a medical emergency, these individuals would be unable to have immediate access to healthcare and instead be required to seek out relatives or friends to make payment on their behalf.</p>
<p>“Would the hospital withhold treatment and turn away those individuals who are unable to make payment by debit or credit cards for genuine or valid reasons?”</p>
<p>Adding on, Chang said cashless systems are also heavily dependent on electricity or internet connectivity.</p>
<p>“In the event of a power outage or system failure, patients or visitors may face disruptions in making payments for critical healthcare services.</p>
<p>“Such reliance on technology could lead to avoidable delays and frustrations during emergencies,” she said.</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 6): The Sabah Forestry Department (SFD) strongly denies allegations in two articles published by the Sarawak Report titled Illegal Logging In Sabah! (By the State Government) dated 1 December, 2024 and Sabah Forestry Admits Log Extraction and Export – Says Timber is Disease Ridden dated December 3, 2024.</p>
<p>Chief Conservator of Forests Datuk Frederick Kugan said the Sarawak Report falsely cited a press release by the SFD on the latter article.</p>
<p>He said SFD denied having issued the press release.<br />
&#8220;This is an irresponsible act done with malicious intent by the Sarawak Report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sabah Forestry Department will lodge a police report,&#8221; Kugan said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>On the first article, he said the allegation by the Sarawak Report that timber is being flushed out without proper dues being paid is incorrect. &#8220;SFD has been collecting royalties from the extraction of Acacia mangium trees in accordance with the Forest Rules 1969,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On the issue of the Ceratocystis wilt disease outbreak, Kugan said SFD in coordination with Yayasan Sabah, are taking steps to contain and eliminate the threat posed by this disease. &#8220;This issue was raised and discussed at the State Legislative Assembly sitting in November,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>KAPIT (Dec 6): A 46-year-old man sparked panic in a public area here after bringing a samurai sword, allegedly with the intention to attack his friends after a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Kapit police chief DSP Rohana Nanu said the incident occurred at 7.30pm last Wednesday at a public restroom.</p>
<p>The suspect, who was under the influence of alcohol, acted aggressively before police arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>“The police acted swiftly upon receiving reports from the public, and the suspect was successfully apprehended before the situation escalated further. The weapon was also seized,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rohana said the suspect was detained under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Dangerous Weapons Act 1958.</p>
<p>She also reminded the public not to carry or possess dangerous weapons such as machetes, folding knives, spears, small axes or other weapons listed in the Second Schedule of the Act without valid reasons.</p>
<p>“Anyone violating this law can face an imprisonment term of not less than five years and not more than 10 years, as well as caning,” she said.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 6): There is a big market for pickup trucks in Sabah and Sarawak due to the increased development taking place there, said Sime Darby Auto ConneXion (SDAC) managing director Turse Zuhair Nahason Affan.</p>
<p>He said as such, SDAC — the sole distributor of all Ford vehicles in Malaysia — aims to introduce more of its Ranger pickup vehicles to suit the topography and utility needs in Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
<p>“There is definitely a big market there. Individually, Sabah and Sarawak have thousands of pickup truck sales. That’s why we see Sabah and Sarawak as market where we want to introduce more of our (Ford) products to the people there.</p>
<p>“I think Sabah and Sarawak are states which are increasingly developing with their own vision. This coincides with our (Ford) products, which have their own unique characteristics, in terms of technology and dynamics that appeal to customers in Sabah and Sarawak,” he said to East Malaysia media representatives prior to flagging off the ‘Live the Ranger Life’ at Sime Darby Motors City, Ara Damansara here recently.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225372" style="width: 2570px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225372" class="size-full wp-image-1225372" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/kch-061224-sa-ford-p1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2022" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225372" class="wp-caption-text">Turse Zuhair (far right) leads the flagging off of the &#8216;Live the Ranger Life&#8217; programme. — Photo courtesy of SDAC-Ford</p></div>
<p>A total of 12 media representatives from Sabah and Sarawak, including social media representatives, took part in the three-day programme which saw them test-driving various Ford Ranger models on the highway and off-road trails.</p>
<p>On another matter, he said lower diesel prices due to diesel subsidy exemption for Sabah and Sarawak will enable the sales of diesel-powered pickup trucks, including from Ford, to go on as usual.</p>
<p>He added SDAC has its own plans for Sarawak to better serve its Ford customers.</p>
<p>“For Sarawak, we have presence in the major towns and this year, we also start to have some service in secondary towns, like smaller towns in Sarawak. So with that, we hope we can serve our customers more effectively and expand our network,” he said.</p>
<p>Turse Zuhair said the Ford Raptor is currently the best-selling model, in terms of pickup trucks, in Malaysia due to its higher technology which caters to a consumer base that seeks quality and performance.</p>
<p>He said the other models, namely the XLT, XLT Plus Special Edition, WildTrak and the high-end Ford Raptor 3.0 V6 are also popular among Malaysian Ford customers.</p>
<p>“We have our unique customer segment — on the high-end side, we have the Raptor and we have also the Platinum model that we launched last year, as well as Stormtrak we just launched this year.</p>
<p>“We also have the entry-level products, like the XLT Automatic Transmission, which is now going inroads into those customers who are looking for a workhorse. So for our XLT Auto, it&#8217;s something that I think customers in Sabah and Sarawak will like.</p>
<p>“With the infotainment display and also technology we have in the range, this entry-level product will be easier accessible to customers in Sabah and Sarawak who are looking for a workhorse,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He noted the next-generation Ford Everest series is also picking up interest among enthusiasts of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) both in the Peninsular and Borneo regions.</p>
<p>“There are customers who like these kinds of seven-seater SUVs, so we see there is demand in Sabah and Sarawak,” he said.</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 6): The Sabah Forestry Department has been awarded the Ecosystem Restoration Field Verification Certificate, in recognition of the dedication to restore the orang utan habitat in the Ulu Segama-Malua Sustainable Forest Management Project (USM SFMP) in Lahad Datu, Sabah.</p>
<p>The Chief Conservator of Forests, Datuk Frederick Kugan, emphasized that the certification signifies the department’s commitment to holistic ecosystem restoration, encompassing not just forests and trees, but also their biodiversity and ecological functions.</p>
<p>Ecosystem restoration is critical in addressing climate change, aiding the recovery of degraded ecosystems and conserving those that remain intact. This achievement underscores Sabah’s proactive role in promoting sustainable and resilient landscapes for a better and healthier planet.</p>
<p>The certificate is valid for five years (November 2024 – November 2029), subject to compliance with verification requirements. It was issued by an internationally recognized certification body, Preferred by Nature (PbN).<br />
PbN has conducted a comprehensive field audit to evaluate the ecological, economic, and social performance of the restoration efforts in Compartment 153 (200 hectares) at Lower Kawag, part of USM SFMP, from September 3 to 5, 2024.</p>
<p>This globally recognized Ecosystem Restoration Verification Standard, developed by PbN, evaluates on-the-ground restoration efforts, ensuring compliance with best practices in sustainability and environmental recovery. Passing this rigorous evaluation reflects the Sabah Forestry Department’s dedication to sustainable forest management and ecosystem conservation, in achieving a balance ecological integrity, community well-being, and economic development.</p>

<p>MIRI (Dec 6): Pakatan Harapan (PH) Sarawak secretary Alan Ling has expressed disappointment over the opposition&#8217;s accusations regarding Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim&#8217;s assets.</p>
<p>Ling was reacting to a statement by PAS assemblyman, Mohd Yusni Mat Piah, that Anwar was one of the richest leaders in the world.</p>
<p>Mohd Yusni had been reported to have accused the Prime Minister of being the 17th richest leader in the world, by citing an unauthentic source, namely &#8216;Love Money&#8217;. However, Mohd Yusni has since apologised and withdrawn the statement.</p>
<p>Ling agreed with the statement by Datuk Ahmad Farhan Fauzi, the political secretary to the Prime Minister, that the accusation was baseless, defamatory and a personal attack.</p>
<p>Ahmad Farhan said compared to other leaders in Malaysia, the value of Anwar’s assets was not among the highest.</p>
<p>On another note, Ling, who is also the secretary of Democratic Action Party (DAP) Sarawak, said in the effort to develop the country towards a modern and developed nation, leaders must be united and mature in their thinking.</p>
<p>He said they must be constructive in their criticism to make the country&#8217;s leadership and administration better, for the benefit of all the people.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that spreading slander is an irresponsible act and does not bring any benefit to the people.</p>
<p>Instead, he added, every leader should use their position to convene, to voice the people’s needs to the authorities and not to attack the dignity of others.</p>
<p>“Why play up personal issues when there are many development and welfare issues to be raised, to overcome and improve,” stressed Ling.</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 6): The Tamu Desa Project launched in 2024, is a new initiative by the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives (KUSKOP).</p>
<p>Its minister Datuk Ewon Benedick said the inspiration for the project came from his personal experience when growing up.</p>
<p>“When I was growing up, I helped my mother sell vegetables and other crops at roadside stalls. Sometimes, my mother would take me to Pekan Nabalu and Tamparuli market to sell agricultural products, especially coffee beans.</p>
<p>“At that time, villagers built their roadside stalls with their own funds and sourced for materials from the jungle around them. So, when I joined this ministry, I felt assisting mothers who sell at local markets or roadside stalls was necessary,” he said.</p>
<p>Ewon added that even before becoming an elected representative, he frequently visited weekly markets in Kadamaian, Taginambur, and other weekly markets where he observed and noted the need for improvements, particularly in infrastructure and upgrades.</p>
<p>“This initiative was also inspired when, for the first time, the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives conducted budget engagement sessions. Previously, these sessions were only held in Kuala Lumpur to gather input and suggestions from the ministry’s stakeholders, including micro and small enterprises.</p>
<p>“After taking the lead at this ministry, I also requested similar engagement sessions in Saban and Sarawak to prepare the budget before submitting our proposals to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</p>
<p>“These three foundational aspects strengthened my resolve to bring this matter to the ministry. I presented it to the MOF, requesting an allocation in the annual budget starting this year. This will enable the ministry to implement the Tamu Desa Project, aimed at constructing new community markets or upgrading existing markets and roadside stalls,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister stressed that the Tamu Desa program must become an annual initiative to effectively support small traders in the country.</p>
<p>According to the Penampang Member of Parliament, the Tamu Desa not only helps small traders but also contributes to the country’s economic growth by enhancing business activities, reducing rural poverty, and strengthening the local entrepreneurship and trade sectors, ultimately boosting the tourism sector.</p>
<p>“All these efforts have a positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and overall economic well-being. Tamu Desa serves as a marketplace for local products (such as agricultural produce and handicrafts), which helps to boost the production and trade of local goods.</p>
<p>“It also provides opportunities for local products to reach broader markets, thereby increasing national revenue through the sale of high-quality domestic products,” he said.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225330" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225330" class="size-full wp-image-1225330" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/Kuala-Penyu.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225330" class="wp-caption-text">Ewon visiting the Tamu Desa in Kuala Penyu.</p></div>
<p>Ewon who is also Kadamaian assemblyman disclosed that a total of 92 Tamu Desa projects in Sabah and Sarawak are planned for 2024, to be implemented in two phases.</p>
<p>He explained that Phase 1 would involve 49 projects (Sabah-36, Sarawak-13), and Phase 2 would include 43 projects (Sabah-18, Sarawak-25). All facilities are expected to be fully completed by the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>This goal, he said, could be achieved by establishing the Tamu Desa project as a local economic growth hub that benefits traders and residents, creating a platform with long-term positive impacts for small traders.</p>
<p>“KUSKOP is collaborating strategically with the Ministry of International Trade, Industry, and Investment Sarawak (MINTRED) and the Ministry of Public Health, Housing, and Local Government Sarawak (MPHLG) to coordinate the implementation of Tamu Desa projects by the Local Authorities in Sarawak.</p>
<p>“For Tamu Desa projects in Sabah, KUSKOP is working strategically with the Sabah Ministry of Rural Development, the Sabah State Development Office, and District Offices to ensure the success of these projects,” he added.</p>
<p>Ewon said that in the presentation of the MADANI Budget 2025 by the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, on October 18, 2024, the government is committed to ensuring that stalls, kiosks, and markets are comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>For this purpose, he said, an allocation of RM100 million has been set aside for building kiosks and upgrading the infrastructure of public markets across all local authorities nationwide, including improving business facilities under DBKL and MARA.</p>
<p>“This effort also aims to provide trading spaces for small traders in Tamu Desa in Sabah and Sarawak. However, the exact allocation for Tamu Desa in Sabah and Sarawak has yet to be received by KUSKOP.</p>
<p>“KUSKOP will collaborate with the Sabah and Sarawak state governments, where District Offices in Sabah and local authorities in Sarawak will be appointed as implementing agencies to develop better and more conducive Tamu Desa premises and provide comfortable facilities for traders and visitors,” he said.</p>
<p>Ewon also said that there are Members of Parliament from Peninsular Malaysia who have suggested implementing the Tamu Desa program in their constituencies, particularly in rural areas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ewon stated that since last year, his ministry has launched a Special Financing Scheme for those conducting business in community markets.</p>
<p>“Through this program, we have seen very encouraging responses, and many have taken advantage of the loans to start small businesses. The capital loans of up to RM5,000 are very helpful for mothers who are just beginning to venture into business,” he said.</p>
<p>He explained that to empower small traders, his ministry not only provides infrastructure and loan facilities but also establishes a strategic plan encouraging all traders to contribute to the Social Security Organization (SOCSO) for social protection.</p>
<p>“Additionally, we want all small traders to have business licenses, whether issued by district offices or trading permits from local authorities,” he said.</p>

<p>BINTULU (Dec 6): Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu campus (UPMKB) unveiled Sarawak’s first-ever master’s degree programme in renewable energy during the Bintulu Sustainability Award (BiSA) event here recently.</p>
<p>The master’s programme by coursework is offered by the university’s Faculty of Humanities, Management and Science, and Department of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The programme’s launching at the inaugural BiSA event was to serve Sarawak’s initiatives in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) development, in line with Post Covid-19 Development Strategy 2030 and Bintulu Development Authority’s strategic plans.</p>
<p>According to programme coordinator Dr Omar Faruqi Marzuki, this programme is tailored to meet the region&#8217;s growing demand for skilled professionals in renewable energy.</p>
<p>“The response has been incredible. Many attendees recognise the importance of this programme in shaping Sarawak&#8217;s renewable energy landscape and express their intention to learn more,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Designed to nurture professionals capable of addressing complex challenges in renewable energy, he said the master’s programme on renewable energy covers a total of 42 credit hours of compulsory courses including dissertation, as well as elective courses.</p>
<p>“Its curriculum covers cutting-edge topics like drone technology, green engineering, and wind energy, which aligns with Sarawak’s sustainable development priorities to provide graduates with the expertise to lead in these critical fields,” he said.</p>
<p>“The programme’s introduction comes at a pivotal time when sustainability is at the forefront of Sarawak&#8217;s development agenda,” he added.</p>
<p>To learn more about the programme, e-mail Omar Faruqi (omar_faruqi@upm.edu.my), or the faculty’s deputy dean (tdpps.fkps_btu@upm.edu.my).</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 6): The towering, overgrown trees near the historic air raid shelter at Jalan Taman Budaya here pose a potential risk to safety, said Democratic Action Party (DAP) member Michael Kong.</p>
<p>Kong, a special aide to DAP Sarawak chairman Chong Chieng Jen, said this is due to the trees being termite-infested and having shallow roots.</p>
<p>He said the trees – reaching over 100 feet and with dense, heavy canopies – have never been ‘pollarded’ or had their top and branches trimmed.</p>
<p>“Many are infested with termites, further compromising their stability. Adding to the danger, these trees grow on a thin layer of sandy topsoil due to the underground air raid shelter&#8217;s concrete structures, preventing proper root penetration and anchoring,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kong said the combination of shallow roots, heavy canopies, and structural damage from termites has already led to incidents of trees snapping or falling without warning.</p>
<p>He was also informed by residents near Jalan Taman Budaya of them having heard loud cracking sounds from fallen trees in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“This mirrors past tragedies such as the Penang Peranakan Mansion incident, where falling trees caused fatalities, as well as in the January 2023 incident where a large tree crushed a vehicle at the Reservoir Park.</p>
<p>“The risk at Jalan Taman Budaya is even higher as the area is frequented by tourists and locals, increasing the potential for a fatal accident,” he said.</p>
<p>Kong claimed the residents there had raised their concerns with Kuching North City Commission (DBKU) councillor Sih Hua Tong, yet no concrete action had been taken to date.</p>
<p>“This inaction is unacceptable. DBKU must act immediately to trim and pollard these overgrown trees so as to reduce canopy weight, as well as to address termite infestations and conduct regular site inspections to ensure public safety.</p>
<p>“Proper maintenance not only mitigates risks but also encourages new growth, preserving their ecological and historical significance,” said Kong, who also acknowledged the importance of conserving the historic trees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Utility and Telecommunication Datuk Dr Abdul Rahman Junaidi, who is minister in charge of DBKU, acknowledged the issue and assured that measures are being taken.</p>
<p>“We are handling the matter and will proceed with further action,” he told <em>The Borneo Post</em> when contacted.</p>

<p>TAWAU (Dec 6): The High Court here was told on Thursday that the long-sleeved shirt, trousers and fast track analysis (FTA) card belonging to Lahad Datu Vocational College student Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat Mohd Narul Azwan, who was found dead at the college, contained the victim&#8217;s blood specimen.</p>
<p>A total of 90 exhibits were presented to the court at the trial of the case on Thursday, including towel, blanket, socks, mattress scraps, nail samples, blood, hair, phone charger cables and cotton buds.</p>
<p>Also presented were the shirt, trousers and FTA card containing specimens from 13 of the accused.</p>
<p>During the proceedings before Judge Datuk Duncan Sikodol, Malaysian Department of Chemistry Science Officer Hamidah Naim Muhamad Rizam, who analysed the exhibits, also identified the case items.</p>
<p>&#8220;I identified them from the laboratory sticker that was attached to the exhibit and signed by me,&#8221; said the 21st prosecution witness during examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Nur Nisla Abd Latif.</p>
<p>A total of 13 college students aged between 16 and 19 years were charged with jointly murdering Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat, 17, in Dormitory Room 7 Resak and 5 Belian, Lahad Datu Vocational College from 9 pm on March 21 to 7.38 am on March 22.</p>

<p>Earlier, the 20th prosecution witness, a student at the college, said he saw the seventh accused joined the fight with Mohamand Nazmie Aizzat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person they beat was Ijat (Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat). I saw the seventh accused punch and kick Ijat&#8217;s body, also seen hitting the victim were the third to 10th accused,&#8221; he said during examination by deputy public prosecutor Batrisyia Mohd Khusri.</p>
<p>Apart from Nur Nisla and Batrisyia, the prosecution was conducted together with deputy public prosecutor Ng Juhn Tao.</p>
<p>Eight of the 13 teenagers were represented by lawyers Datuk Ram Singh, Kamarudin Mohmad Chinki, and Chen Wen Jye; while the other five accused were represented by lawyers Mohamad Zairi Zainal Abidin, Abdul Ghani Zelika, Vivian Thien, Jhesseny P Kang, and Kusni Ambotuwo.<br />

<p>KUCHING (Dec 6): Former chief justice Tun Datuk Seri Panglima Richard Malanjum is the best candidate for the next Governor of Sabah, said political scientist Datuk Prof Dr Jayum Jawan.</p>
<p>Jayum, a member of the National Unity Advisory Council and a fellow of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, made the statement in response to Warisan Sabah vice-president Terrence Siambun’s proposal for Malanjum to be appointed as the next Governor of Sabah.</p>
<p>“Richard Malanjum has indeed distinguished himself in Sabah and in Malaysia. There can be no better candidate than him to sit in the office of Governor of Sabah.</p>
<p>“He is a non-political figure and has wide experience in the judiciary and a motivation as well for East Malaysians because he has sat in the highest office of the Malaysian judiciary,” Jayum said in a statement.</p>
<p>Elaborating, Jayum said that Malanjum’s demeanour is impeccable.</p>
<p>“He is highly suited for the role because, without entrenched political connections, he would remain above politics, as the office of the Governor should be.</p>
<p>“This makes him an excellent Governor for all ethnicities in Sabah, as he would be fair and open to everyone without being beholden to any political group. He stands out as a leading candidate compared to some of the other names being suggested for Sabah’s highest office,” he said.</p>
<p>Jayum also said that Malanjum’s Christian background should not be an issue.</p>
<p>“What matters is his patriotism. During the Malaysia negotiations, the East Malaysian regions insisted that neither region should have a state religion. Appointing Malanjum would demonstrate that Sabah is capable of leading in the governance of a pluralistic and multi-ethnic country.</p>
<p>“Additionally, only in Sabah have the positions of Chief Minister been rotated among Chinese, Kadazandusun, Bajau and other ethnic groups over the past 60 years since Malaysia’s formation in 1963,” he added.</p>
<p>Siambun in a statement published in The Borneo Post yesterday praised Malanjum’s exceptional track record and steadfast dedication to justice and unity, emphasising that the retired judge is the first East Malaysian to serve as the nation’s top judge.</p>
<p>“His highest achievement thus far is as Ombudsman of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>“With his unparalleled legal expertise, commitment to justice and dedication to the wellbeing of all Sabahans, he is an exemplary candidate for this esteemed role.</p>
<p>“His tenure (as chief justice) was marked by respect for Malaysia’s constitutional framework, including the recognition of Islam as the religion of the federation, while safeguarding the rights of all communities.</p>
<p>“This proposal does not in any way jeopardise the position of Islam in Sabah. As guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, Islam’s status as the religion of the federation remains intact and respected,” he said.</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 6): As part of Kuching’s transformation into a smart city, the Kuching South City Council (MBKS) has installed two smart poles within its jurisdiction, located in Padungan and Mile 3.</p>
<p>These installations are a part of a broader initiative to erect 135 smart poles across Kuching Division under the Kuching Smart City Master Plan 2021-2025.</p>
<p>The project is overseen by the Sarawak Multimedia Authority (SMA).</p>
<p>Kuching South Mayor Datuk Wee Hong Seng highlighted the council’s contributions, including securing wayleave approvals and ensuring compliance with local regulations.</p>
<p>“These surveillance systems are crucial for enhancing security and monitoring in the city,” Wee told The Borneo Post.</p>
<p>“Each pole is equipped with advanced features, including a pan-tilt-zoom camera, fixed bullet cameras for a 360-degree view, horn speakers for emergency alerts, a panic button for immediate assistance, and backup power for uninterrupted operation.”</p>
<p>When asked about the possibility of installing more smart poles under MBKS’ purview, Wee said it would depend on additional funding.</p>
<p>“The ‘Bandar Selamat’ funding under MBKS would provide that extra funding.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225352" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225352" class="size-full wp-image-1225352" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/kch-051224-ay-poles-p2.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225352" class="wp-caption-text">The smart pole installed under MBKS’ jurisdiction at Jalan Abel, Padungan.</p></div>
<p>“If we have more funding, we will consult with SMA and the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) before deciding on locations to complement SMA’s efforts,” he said, adding that the current smart pole locations were proposed by local councils and endorsed by PDRM.</p>
<p>Wee also assured the public of access to surveillance footage, clarifying that residents must lodge a police report to request recordings for incidents near private properties.</p>
<p>The police will then coordinate with the relevant authorities to retrieve the necessary evidence, he added.</p>
<p>The two poles installed by MBKS underline the council’s commitment to advancing smart city infrastructure and enhancing public safety.</p>
<p>When funding becomes available, MBKS plans to continue its collaboration with stakeholders to expand these initiatives, in line with Sarawak’s vision for a digitally connected and secure urban environment.</p>
<p>Though the total cost of the project could not immediately be released, Wee reaffirmed the council’s commitment to supporting initiatives that improve public safety and align with Sarawak’s vision for a smart city.</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 6): A team of third and fourth year civil engineering undergraduates from Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak secured the first runner-up position at the national-level IEM-ICP Pile Prediction Competition.</p>
<p>As the sole team from East Malaysia, members Stephanie Ha Sze Ting, Mandy Lam Xing Ying, Hii Wang Cheong, and Marc Harting Ajin demonstrated exceptional skills, determination and innovative problem-solving abilities, said the university in a release.</p>
<p>Organised by the Institution of Engineers Malaysia and its Geotechnical Engineering Technical Division, the competition brought together top civil engineering students from across the nation to address intricate real-world engineering challenges.</p>
<p>“It tested the participants’ ability to estimate pile capacity using real-world data, including a Static Load Test Report and Soil Investigation Report.</p>
<p>“A challenge that revolved around analysing a 500mm diameter spun pile with a penetration depth of 25.5 meters required high levels of technical proficiency and analytical precision,” said Swinburne Sarawak.</p>
<p>The team, under the guidance of academic advisor Dr Choo Chung Siung – also the university’s Centre for Innovative Society director – and industrial advisor Chen Chuang Loom, presented their findings to a panel of esteemed judges during the competition’s final stage.</p>
<p>Choo in the release said this achievement exemplified Swinburne’s commitment to nurturing globally competitive graduates capable of excelling in real-world engineering contexts.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world challenges, ensuring our students are prepared to be both job takers and job creators in the dynamic engineering field,” he said.</p>
<p>He added this accomplishment follows Swinburne Sarawak’s victory in the inaugural edition of the competition last year, further solidifying the university’s reputation as a leader in civil engineering education.</p>
<p>“This competition is just the beginning. This milestone strengthens our drive to be a prototype of global best practice, championing innovation and collaboration across disciplines and industries.</p>
<p>“We aim to enhance career readiness through work-integrated learning, ensuring our graduates are well-equipped for the evolving demands of the industry.”</p>
<p>Swinburne is an Australian university based in Melbourne, Australia. The Sarawak Campus in Kuching is the only international, full-fledged branch campus of the university.</p>
<p>Swinburne is ranked among the top one per cent of universities globally in the QS World University Rankings 2024 and the latest Academic Ranking of World Universities, and Swinburne Sarawak has been recognised as one of the country’s Top 10 Preferred Private Universities by JobStreet.com.</p>

<p>HARARE (Dec 6): Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is gaining popularity in Zimbabwe following the opening of a TCM exhibition room at the Zimbabwe-China TCM and Acupuncture Center, located at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the country&#8217;s capital of Harare.</p>
<p>The exhibition room, which opened in June, aims to introduce the TCM culture and therapy to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;TCM is not just acupuncture. It has a lot of other methods, other therapies, and other theories,&#8221; said Hu Sha, director of the center.</p>
<p>In addition to the well-known acupuncture therapy that involves inserting thin needles into targeted areas of the body, the exhibition room showcases various aspects of TCM, such as samples of Chinese herbs, cupping tools, massage therapy tools, methods of preparing Chinese herbs, and ancient books on TCM, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this will be a good platform and window for local people to learn about TCM and promote cooperation between TCM and Zimbabwean local traditional medicine,&#8221; Hu said.</p>
<p>The number of patients receiving free treatment at the TCM and Acupuncture Center has increased significantly since the center opened its doors to the public in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;We treat between 30 and 60 people every working day, and our appointments have been scheduled until next February.</p>
<p>“I am happy that people can trust and believe in TCM, and I am also glad that TCM can help them treat diseases and relieve pain,&#8221; she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225338" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225338" class="size-full wp-image-1225338" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/med2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225338" class="wp-caption-text">A Chinese doctor treats a patient with acupuncture at the Zimbabwe-China TCM and Acupuncture Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, on Dec 2, 2024. &#8211; Xinhua photo</p></div>
<p>Patients who spoke to Xinhua said the center has provided much-needed relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I come here, I feel calm; it&#8217;s like my body is rejuvenated, and I&#8217;m stronger than before,&#8221; said Harare resident Farai Mugwisi, who decided to try acupuncture after experiencing headaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remembered that I had a similar problem when I was in China, and I went to a traditional medical center, so I searched on Facebook and found this place.</p>
<p>“When I came here, my left eye was closed, but after the acupuncture, my eye was wide open, and I slept well for the first time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She then introduced her mother to acupuncture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother is a stroke patient, so I brought her in. She was doing physical therapy somewhere, and when she came back for a session, her therapist said, &#8216;You&#8217;ve improved a lot! What happened?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Luisa Maidza, another beneficiary of TCM, said the ancient technique helped her relieve back pain that had plagued her for more than a decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful thing to receive such life-changing treatment without cost,&#8221; she, 58, said.</p>
<p>To help meet the demand for TCM in Zimbabwe, a group of 10 locals enrolled and graduated from a TCM personnel training course held at the center in 2022.</p>
<p>Munashe Mboneka, an assistant at the center, decided to enroll in the training course after realizing the benefits and growing demand for TCM in the southern African country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud to say that our TCM clinic is becoming more and more popular. People are recognizing the benefits and natural healing methods of TCM, and our clinic&#8217;s approach resonates with those seeking effective, long-term health solutions.</p>
<p>“This growing popularity motivates us to continue providing the best possible care to our community,&#8221; said Mboneka. &#8211; Xinhua</p>

<p>HARBIN (Dec 6): Trucks laden with massive ice blocks are making their way through freshly fallen snow, heading for the Ice-Snow World site in Harbin, the capital of northeast China&#8217;s Heilongjiang Province.</p>
<p>These massive blocks, preserved from last winter, will be transformed into spectacular sculptures for the 26th edition of Harbin Ice-Snow World, set to open in mid-December.</p>
<p>The event marks the return of one of China&#8217;s most iconic winter theme parks, expected to draw millions of visitors and make a significant impact on the region&#8217;s winter tourism industry.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the beauty of the ice-construction landscape, the ice blocks will go through a strict inspection on thickness, length and cleanliness before being used, said Yang Liu with Harbin Ice and Snow World Park Co Ltd.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 ice construction workers and nearly 1,000 pieces of mechanical operation equipment will enter the park for the construction process.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s park will feature a large-scale upgrade and is expected to break the Guinness World Record again, reaffirming its position as the largest ice-and-snow theme park in the world.</p>
<p>According to sources with Harbin Ice-Snow World, the park will expand from 810,000 square meters to a massive 1 million square meters.</p>
<p>The amount of ice and snow used will also increase to 300,000 cubic meters, further enhancing its scale and grandeur.</p>
<p>The number of popular ice slides will increase from 16 to 24, offering even more excitement for visitors, said Sun Zemin, deputy director of the sales and marketing department of Harbin Ice-Snow World Park Co Ltd.</p>
<p>He added that the ice sculptures and snow constructions this year will feature elements from the upcoming 2025 Asian Winter Games, adding a unique touch to the experience.</p>
<p>Harbin, known as the &#8220;Ice City,&#8221; has garnered attention on social media due to its rich ice-and-snow resources, as well as its vibrant winter tourism scene.</p>
<p>Last year, Harbin Ice-Snow World attracted over 2.7 million visitors with its stunning ice sculptures and winter-themed attractions.</p>
<p>The city has long been investing in winter resources and hosting events such as winter sports games and ice lantern fairs, aiming to transform these resources into a thriving economy.</p>
<p>It serves as a vital economic hub in northeast China and as a barometer of the nation&#8217;s snow-and-ice industry.</p>
<p>In addition to Harbin, the &#8220;Snow Town&#8221; in the city of Mudanjiang, located about 280 kilometers from Harbin, has also become a must-see destination for winter tourism.</p>
<p>Known for its long winter season and unique mushroom-shaped snow formations, Snow Town attracted over 500,000 visitors last winter.</p>
<p>This year, the town has expanded its offerings, adding a forest pathway and riverside commercial street, and will host snow marathons and outdoor disco-dancing competitions, providing even more activities for winter lovers.</p>
<p>Boasting more than 50 ski trails of varying difficulty levels, the Yabuli Ski Resort is one of China&#8217;s premier ski resorts.</p>
<p>In preparation for the upcoming Asian Winter Games, the resort has undergone significant upgrades to its ski slopes, dining facilities and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaodong, head of the culture and tourism department at the Yabuli administrative committee, said that the resort is collaborating with other tourist destinations to create several &#8220;golden&#8221; ice-and-snow tourism routes.</p>
<p>This winter, the resort will also introduce large snow-based entertainment activities, such as alpine snow circles, snow carnivals and night skiing, to attract even more tourists.</p>
<p>According to Qi Bin, deputy director of the Heilongjiang provincial department of culture and tourism, the peak winter tourism season this year will coincide with the 9th Asian Winter Games, which is expected to further drive interest in winter sports and ice-and-snow tourism.</p>
<p>Heilongjiang is committed to supporting the ice-and-snow economy and generating growth opportunities for the local economy, Qi added.</p>
<p>The surge in winter tourism in Harbin is part of a broader trend across China&#8217;s booming ice-and-snow industry.</p>
<p>Experts attribute the rising popularity of winter sports to the success of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, which significantly boosted interest in winter sports and tourism.</p>
<p>China has unveiled an ambitious plan to grow its ice-and-snow economy, targeting winter sports, tourism and equipment manufacturing as key drivers of economic growth, with a projected value of 1.5 trillion yuan (about US$208.7 billion) by 2030. &#8211; Xinhua</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 5): A young artist from Borneo is transforming discarded polyester plastic into stunning textiles, blending tradition and sustainability in his Kenyalang Circus exhibition.</p>
<p>Marcos Kueh, 29, a Chinese-Malaysian based in the Netherlands, is showcasing his vibrant creations at the National Art Gallery.</p>
<p>His designs combine fluorescent threads with cultural narratives, inspired by his roots in Malaysia and Borneo, as well as the chaotic beauty of street advertisements and multinational brand logos.</p>
<p>“Growing up, I was surrounded by plastics and stories about how they often end up in Malaysia. This project reimagines these materials, turning waste into something beautiful,” he said during a media preview of the exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Kueh said plastics are collected, recycled into yarns in Europe and woven into textiles.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is a major focus in Europe, and we aim to use fully recycled materials,” he added.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225342" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225342" class="size-full wp-image-1225342" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/FW1438941_KL43_05122024_BALAI_SENI-lpr.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225342" class="wp-caption-text">Kueh&#8217;s designs combine fluorescent threads with cultural narratives, inspired by his roots in Malaysia and Borneo, as well as the chaotic beauty of street advertisements and multinational brand logos. &#8211; Bernama photo</p></div>
<p>The project, which began in 2016 as a graphic design collage during his studies, evolved into a textile venture after he learned weaving in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>His work also delves into post-colonial narratives.</p>
<p>“Before paper and pen, people in Sarawak wove their stories into textiles. I find it romantic to bring that tradition into the modern world, weaving today’s stories into fabrics for future generations,” he added.</p>

<p>SIBU (Dec 5): A 33-year-old police sergeant pleaded not guilty in the Magistrates’ Court here today to five charges of cheating a senior citizen out of over RM500,000.</p>
<p>Philip Luney made the plea before Magistrate Romario Jonoi after the charges under Section 420 of the Penal Code were read to him by a court interpreter.</p>
<p>The Section provides for between one and 10 years in prison and caning, as well as a fine, upon conviction.</p>
<p>He is charged with cheating a 66-year-old man by deceiving the latter into handing over a total of RM523,650 on the promise that the money would be returned.</p>
<p>The alleged offences took place on Oct 18, Oct 31, Nov 10, Dec 13 and Dec 29 in different locations here.</p>
<p>The magistrate fixed pre-trial case management for Feb 3, 2025 and allowed Philip to be released on undeposited cash bail of RM10,000 with two local sureties.</p>
<p>Deputy public prosecutor Aiman Zarith Zahrullail handled the prosecution, while counsel Yap Hoi Liong appeared for the accused.</p>
