This increasingly chronic shortage of human resources has created a vicious cycle, exacerbated by the large numbers of people seeking care at public hospitals&#8217; emergency and trauma departments, outpatient services, and congested government health clinics.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>ANWAR Ibrahim’s former research assistant, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther, was arrested after he was found in possession of two pistols and more than 300 grams of marijuana, his lawyer Rafique Rashid said.<br /><br />Rafique said his client has maintained that the pistols and drugs “were planted” by those who have an axe to grind with him.<br /><br />The lawyer said Yusoff has been in police custody since September 6 after he was detained by a group of Kuala Lumpur police officers who allegedly found the guns and drugs in his car.<br /><br />“On September 6 approximately 9.30 am, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther was arrested by a team of police in Kuala Lumpur. The police reportedly found two pistols and drugs suspected to be marijuana (gross weight) 305g in the car he was in.<br /><br />“Yusoff is now in custody until his remand ends on September 12.<br /><br />“Investigation is under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, after the first remand related to the Firearms Act 1960 was rejected.<br /><br />“Yusoff has clearly stated to the police that the guns and drugs do not belong to him and he has nothing to do with the items. A urine test to test for drug abuse was also negative,” said Rafique.<br /><br />In July 2021, Yusoff filed a suit against Anwar claiming that the latter sexually assaulted him.<br /><br />He had sought, among others, special, general, aggravated and exemplary damages, as well as interest, costs and other relief deemed fit by the court.<br /><br />Anwar, in his statement of defence filed on September 28, 2021, claimed that Yusoff had lied under oath to the authorities regarding the sexual assault.<br /><br />According to the PKR president, who filed a counterclaim on the same date (September 28), Yusoff had concocted a story about sexual assault to tarnish his political career to ensure he does not become prime minister.<br /><br />On September 9, 2022, the Kuala Lumpur High Court dismissed Yusoff’s application to strike out several paragraphs in Anwar’s statement of defence and counterclaim.<br /><br />In his statement to the police after his arrest, Yusoff said the weapons and drugs were planted in his car by those with a grudge against him.<br /><br />“Yusoff has provided their names to the police and has requested to lodge a police report on this matter,” said Rafique.<br /><br />“He is also concerned about his safety, adding he has civil cases related to influential individuals which are still ongoing in court.” – September 11, 2024.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>THE recent case of a school bus driver in Malaysia, who was detained after posting videos of young schoolchildren on his TikTok account and referring to one as his “crush,” has ignited public outrage and discussions around sexual misconduct, particularly involving minors. The incident shines a light on two important legal principles: ignorantia juris (ignorance of the law) and ignorantia facti (ignorance of fact). This case not only raises concerns about the ethical responsibilities of individuals in positions of trust but also about the broader issue of how ignorance is treated in criminal cases, especially those involving vulnerable individuals.</p>
