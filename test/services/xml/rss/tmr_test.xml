<p>Deputy public prosecutor Raja Zaizul Faridah Raja Zaharudin informed Sessions Court Judge Dr Syahliza Warnoh that the decision has been communicated to the new legal representatives of Zaim Ikhwan Zahari and Ismanira Abdul Manaf.</p>
<p>“Today was set for the decision on the representation. We have reviewed the letter filed by the previous lawyer, and the representation has been rejected,” said Raja Zaizul Faridah during today’s proceedings.</p>
<p>On June 13, Zaim Ikhwan and Ismanira, both 29, pleaded not guilty at the Sessions Court here to the charge of neglecting the six-year-old autistic child in a manner likely to cause physical harm to him in the PJU Damansara Damai area between noon on Dec 5 and 9.55 pm on Dec 6, 2023.</p>
<p>The charge is under Section 31 (1) (a) of the Child Act 2001 and punishable under Section 31 (1) of the same act read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum fine of RM50,000 or jail term not exceeding 20 years or both, if convicted.</p>
<p>Raja Zaizul Faridah said the prosecution requested&nbsp;Jan 10, 2025, a&nbsp;date agreed upon by both parties, for a mention to update all documents related to the case before the trial begins.</p>
<p>“Compact discs (CDs) related to the case have yet to be handed over as they are still with the forensic department. The prosecution will provide all requested CDs and other documents, if any, before the proposed mention date,” he said.</p>
<p>Lawyer&nbsp;Haresh Mahadevan, representing&nbsp;Zaim Ikhwan and&nbsp;Ismanira, said that apart from the CDs, a forensic report related to an autopsy, which includes samples taken from the deceased body for analysis, has yet to be handed over to the defence.</p>
<p>“Regarding the previously scheduled&nbsp;trial dates, we request the court to vacate Jan 21 to 24, 2025, as we have a hearing involving a police officer.</p>
<p>“We have informed the prosecution, and there are&nbsp;no objections. Alternative dates have also been arranged,” he said.</p>
<p>Judge Syahliza said the&nbsp;prosecution must provide the defence with all relevant documents, including the CDs and&nbsp;forensic report, before the case mention on Jan 10.</p>
<p>“The court also vacates the previously scheduled trial dates from Jan 20 to 24. The trial will now take place from&nbsp;Feb 3 to 7, followed by Feb 17 to 21 and March 10 to 14,” she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters later, Haresh said he had just been appointed to represent&nbsp;Zaim Ikhwan and Ismanira yesterday.</p>
<p>“My clients want to clear their names and are looking forward to the trial starting in February,” he said, adding that the previous representation was submitted by their former lawyer on Nov 19.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lawyer&nbsp;Fahmi Abd Moin, when contacted, said he ceased representing the couple on Dec 4 following instructions from the accused.</p>
<p>On Dec 6, 2023, Zayn Rayyan’s body was found lying in a stream near his home in Idaman Apartment, Damansara Damai near here after being reported missing the day before.</p>
<p>The child is believed to have been murdered when the autopsy results revealed signs of self-defence injuries on his neck and body.&nbsp; &#8212; <strong>BERNAMA</strong></p>

<p><span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> steadfast pursuit of high-quality development, which focuses on high-level opening-up and deepened reforms to further stimulate growth while bolstering economic resilience, not only serves the nation&#8217;s interests, but also injects positive factors into global development, according to experts, business leaders and government officials from home and abroad.</p>
<p>They also said on Thursday that more efforts are needed to enhance the international community&#8217;s understanding of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economic outlook and the global benefits of its high-quality development, which they described as critical for shaping a better future for the world.</p>
<p>The remarks were made at a Vision China event that brought together representatives from international organizations, enterprises, universities and think tanks, who shared insights on <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> high-quality development. The event was jointly held by China Daily and the University of International Business and Economics in <span class="xn-location">Beijing</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Global attention is keenly focused on <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economic trajectory as a source of stability,&#8221; said Qu Yingpu, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is crucial for various stakeholders, including media, businesses, universities and think tanks, to proactively articulate the intrinsic logic of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economic development story, and elucidate the interplay between <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> high-level opening-up and the shared development of nations,&#8221; Qu said.</p>
<p>Such efforts will foster a better understanding within the international community of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economic development prospects and the dividends that its high-quality development offers to the world, he added.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Qiu Xiaoping</span>, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that in-depth exchanges among renowned economists, chambers of commerce and business leaders from home and abroad are of great significance for promoting the high-quality development of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economy and global common development.</p>
<p>Specifically, he said the high-quality growth of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> private sector is set to advance with more robust strides, thanks to the momentum of reforms, the backing of supportive policies, the diligence of enterprises and the collective effort of Chinese society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such progress will perpetually infuse fresh energy into the high-quality development of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economy and harness the power of Chinese private enterprises to contribute to the prosperity and advancement of the global economy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Otton Solis</span>, former special adviser to the president of <span class="xn-location">Costa Rica</span>, suggested that relevant high-quality development goals focusing on production, humanism, sustainability and globalization should be central to both scientific and social research as well as policymaking.</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">China</span>, with its vast size, population, GDP and historical depth, is poised to play a pivotal role in &#8220;inspiring the world to move toward high-quality development&#8221;, he said in a video speech.</p>
<p>During the event, all participants expressed robust confidence in the promising future of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economy.</p>
<p>As the country intensifies endeavors to foster high-quality development and generate new growth momentum and vitality, its growth will benefit others as well, they emphasized.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bright future of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> economy toward high-quality development remains steadfast, undaunted by storms,&#8221; said Qu, the China Daily publisher and editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese economy, featuring high-level openness, offers a vast market and win-win opportunities to the world, and <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> path to modernization presents the world with a Chinese solution and strength for shared prosperity, he said.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Jack Perry</span>, chairman of the 48 Group and CEO of London Export Corp, highlighted that <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> growth has been beneficial to people both within and beyond its borders. In his video speech, he also praised <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> dedication to maintaining a high level of openness.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Steven Barnett</span>, the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s senior resident representative in <span class="xn-location">China</span>, said that 0.9 of a percentage point of the projected global growth of 3.2 percent for this year and next is expected to come from <span class="xn-location">China</span>.</p>
<p>That means the Chinese economy continues to be the primary engine of global growth, contributing more than one-fourth of the world&#8217;s economic expansion, he said.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Safdar Parvez</span>, the Asian Development Bank&#8217;s country director for <span class="xn-location">China</span>, said the institution expects <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> growth in 2024 to be within the target range of about 5 percent set early this year, with recently announced proactive policy measures.</p>
<p>Huang Baoyin, Party secretary of the University of International Business and Economics, pointed out that developing new quality productive forces tailored to local conditions, refining incentive and constraint mechanisms that promote high-quality growth, cultivating new growth drivers, and leveraging greater opening-up are all critical elements of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> development strategy.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Marc Horn</span>, president of Merck China, said the country stands out as a leader in innovation, driven by key strengths like outstanding adaptability and scalability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to an innovative ecosystem, <span class="xn-location">China</span> often quickly leads the world in the adoption of new and disruptive technologies,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">George Xu</span>, executive vice-president of Airbus and CEO of Airbus China, said the company is inspired by <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> commitment to high-quality development and high-level opening-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The immense market size presents a unique opportunity not only for business growth, but also for the high-quality development of the entire industrial chain,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Song Yang</span>, a professor at Renmin University of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> School of Economics and research fellow at the university&#8217;s National Academy of Development and Strategy, underscored that <span class="xn-location">China</span> is on the right track to common prosperity.</p>
<p>Also at the event, Qu, from China Daily, announced that it has been decided to integrate corporate communication resources, guided by the ethos of openness, to establish the China Daily Institute for Corporate Communication. The aim is to tell great stories of how Chinese and foreign enterprises grow with <span class="xn-location">China</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continually expand the global network of enterprise friendships, and drive the exchange and mutual learning of civilizations,&#8221; he sa<span id="spanHghlt781f">id.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-location">BEIJING</span></span>, <span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-chron">Dec. 5, 2024</span></span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Harmony, or &#8220;He,&#8221; lies at the heart of the Chinese civilization, representing a core spiritual value that has shaped the ethos of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of <span class="xn-location">China</span> (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president, has repeatedly emphasized the importance of preserving and promoting <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> outstanding traditional culture, with harmony as one of its most essential elements. At the BRICS Summit held in Kazan in late October, he extended this philosophy on the global stage, calling for harmonious coexistence among civilizations and closer cultural exchanges between nations.</p>
<p>In <span class="xn-location">China</span>, the value of &#8220;He&#8221; is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture, guiding the country through a complex, interconnected world. The Global Times is launching a series &#8220;He Culture in Xi Jinping&#8217;s Quotes of Classics.&#8221; Drawing upon ancient Chinese literature and illuminating examples from President Xi&#8217;s speeches, the series delves into the essence of &#8220;He&#8221; through five interconnected dimensions: Self-cultivation, family management, state governance, bringing peace to all under heaven, and reverence for nature. By highlighting these core aspects of &#8220;He&#8221; culture, the series aims to share <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> unique cultural wisdom with the world, promoting values of peaceful coexistence, mutual prosperity, and harmonious living.</p>
<p>The first installment reveals how grass-roots Party members in <span class="xn-location">Henan</span> practice the wisdom of &#8220;He&#8221; culture, which emphasizes the importance of self-cultivation and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Every time Meng Fanyu, a teacher at the Jiao Yulu Executive Leadership Academy (Jiao Yulu Academy) in Lankao county, <span class="xn-location">Central China&#8217;s</span> <span class="xn-location">Henan Province</span>, strolls past a paulownia tree called &#8220;Jiao Tong,&#8221; planted by Jiao, she recalls President Xi&#8217;s thought-provoking words: &#8220;jian xian si qi,&#8221; an ancient Chinese idiom from <i>The Analects of Confucius</i>.  </p>
<p>In 2014, during his inspection tour to Lankao, the president visited a memorial dedicated to Jiao Yulu (1922-64), a revered figure in Chinese history who served as the Party chief of Lankao county in the early 1960s, where he devoted his life to improving environment and uplifting the lives of local residents despite great physical suffering from illness, leaving an indelible mark on the community before his passing due to live cancer at just 42.</p>
<p>When speaking at a symposium with local officials, Xi urged Party members and officials to use Jiao&#8217;s spirit as a mirror to examine their problems and shortcomings, and called on them to emulate Jiao&#8217;s unwavering dedication, citing the Chinese idiom &#8211; &#8220;jian xian si qi,&#8221; which means &#8220;When you see a person of virtue and capability, you should think of emulating and equaling the person; when you see a person of low caliber, you should reflect on your own weak points.&#8221; </p>
<p>This idiom reflects the philosophy of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> &#8220;He&#8221; culture, emphasizing the importance of self-cultivation and self-improvement and the harmonious unity between the individual and the self.</p>
<p>The idiom&#8217;s lesson resonates deeply within Meng, reminding her to inherit the spirit of Jiao Yulu, which involves loving people, working hard, selflessness, empiricism, and resilience.</p>
<p>Here, at the Jiao Yulu Academy, more and more people like Meng, are striving to inherit Jiao&#8217;s spirit, consolidate their ideals and convictions, gain wisdom, improve conduct, and be more motivated to work even harder. </p>
<p><b>The spirit of Jiao</b></p>
<p>Meng was first greatly moved by the deeds and spirit of Jiao during her university years, when her broadcasting teacher asked her to study and read a long-form feature about Jiao, along with a poem written by Xi, then secretary of the CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, in 1990 to commemorate him. </p>
<p>Under the silvery moonlight of a summer night in 1990, Xi, felt emotional. &#8220;Who, among the common folks, does not appreciate a good public servant?&#8221; Xi then penned a heartfelt poem dedicated to the official. It was carried on a local newspaper the next day, the Xinhua News Agency reported. </p>
<p>Meng immersed herself into reading the piece and was struck by Jiao&#8217;s noble spirit as a grass-roots CPC member, who led the locals to overcome various natural disasters, all while enduring his own suffering from illness. After that, Meng did not hesitate to choose to intern at the Jiao Yulu Academy, and later formally became a teacher at the academy after graduation. </p>
<p>For the Lankao natives, Jiao is not only a respected role model, but also a beloved figure.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Zhang Jing</span>, who has been working at the academy for over 10 years, was born and raised in Lankao. Zhang&#8217;s early impressions of Jiao came from the stories her grandmother told her when she was a child. During heavy rain, while others rushed indoors to seek shelter, Jiao would go outside, wade through the water to check on each household, to see if their roofs were leaking or if their homes had collapsed. </p>
<p>&#8220;My grandmother always told me that Lankao had a good official named Jiao Yulu,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>As a main platform for researching and promoting the spirit of Jiao Yulu nationwide, the Jiao Yulu Academy primarily offers Party spirit education courses for CPC officials at all levels, managers of enterprises and institutions, and professional technical personnel, according to Wen Baisong, deputy secretary of the Party committee and executive vice president of the academy.</p>
<p>With an important education mission, the academy has a group of young teaching staff. Nearly 95 percent of its current body of 115 teaching staffers are aged 35 and below, said Wen. Many of the young teachers chose to leave behind opportunities in big cities after graduation to come to Lankao county, dedicating themselves to promoting Jiao&#8217;s spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young teachers are the fresh blood of our academy &#8211; enthusiastic, creative, and hardworking,&#8221; Wen told Global Times. &#8220;They have been deeply influenced by the spirit of Jiao Yulu since childhood, and most of them possess high academic qualifications and a solid knowledge base, enabling them to passionately and effectively convey the essence of Jiao&#8217;s spirit,&#8221; he praised.</p>
<p><b>Mirror for endeavors</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Jiao built a lasting monument in local people&#8217;s hearts although he only worked in the county for over a year,&#8221; Xi told local officials at the symposium.</p>
<p>&#8220;A question to be pondered is what we can leave for future generations,&#8221; Xi said.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 2013, young teachers at the academy have made great contributions to the innovation and diversity of the courses. Meng, for instance, teaches &#8220;Remembering Jiao Yulu,&#8221; during which students take on various roles related to Jiao, such as his colleagues, family members, and the local people of Lankao, to recreate his image from different perspectives. </p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Zhang Hong</span>, 35, is a developer of themed lectures at the academy. One day, <span class="xn-person">Zhang Hong</span> brought a group of students to Jiao&#8217;s memorial park in Lankao to pay their respects to Jiao. Before they returned to the bus, Zhang noticed that one student had turned back to Jiao&#8217;s tomb, bowing deeply three times and placing flowers from a paulownia tree &#8211; now widely regarded as a symbol of the spirit of Jiao Yulu &#8211; at the grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said she wanted to bring this spirit back into her life and work, making it a mirror for her professional endeavors, and a powerful motivation for her to strive for self-cultivation,&#8221; Zhang told the Global Times. </p>
<p><b>Serve the people</b></p>
<p>For the young teachers at Jiao Yulu Academy, Jiao serves as a mirror of self-examination in their work and life. He not only inspires them to wholeheartedly engage in Party spirit education, but also encourages them to continue to draw motivation from the spirit of hard work and selfless dedication after class, enabling them to better serve the people.</p>
<p>In 2022, <span class="xn-person">Zhang Jing</span> voluntarily signed up for a program, which required grass-roots officials to live in rural areas and work on local poverty alleviation efforts. Reflecting on a family in the village she then worked at, which had two senior members with disabilities living in poor conditions, brought <span class="xn-person">Zhang Jing</span> to tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that moment, I truly felt the profound impact of the spirit of Jiao Yulu on me,&#8221; she said, her voice trembling. &#8220;I thought to myself, if I don&#8217;t do something for them, I would feel extremely guilty.&#8221; Later, with the support of the academy, <span class="xn-person">Zhang Jing</span> and other members of the program gifted the family a television, as well as food items like rice, oil, meat, and eggs. They also purchased a batch of wireless radios for the village, trying hard to offer a helping hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The essence of the spirit of Jiao Yulu is to serve the people wholeheartedly. It embodies a sense of responsibility and a deep emotional commitment,&#8221; <span class="xn-person">Zhang Jing</span> told the Global Times. &#8220;It has been deeply engraved in my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, the paulownia tree that Jiao Yulu planted, located right across from the Jiao Yulu Academy, has witnessed countless visitors, who come with admiration or curiosity for the exemplary qualities of the CPC and its members.</p>
<p>Standing under this &#8220;Jiao Tong,&#8221; Meng feels that she and some other young teachers at the academy are just like the trumpet-shaped flowers of the tree. &#8220;We are like the little &#8216;trumpets&#8217; on the tree, spreading the story of Jiao, and the story of the CPC, to the world,&#8221; she told the Global Times.</p>
<p>Year after year, countless Party members and officials gather with reverence beneath the paulownia tree to honor Jiao, drawing inspiration from this exemplary figure to enhance their own self-cultivation. The wisdom of emulating the virtuous, a key element of <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> &#8220;He&#8221; Culture, is also deeply embedded in the soil of Lankao, much like the robust and flourishing &#8220;Jiao Tong&#8221; that stands tall.</p>
