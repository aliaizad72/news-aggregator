      <description><![CDATA[The Sabah state government has accused Sarawak Report of lying. Except in the same statement it admits Sarawak Report was correct in reporting that logs are being extracted from the SFI Licence area despite a court order that all activity should cease.  The statement  further states the timber being shipped for export is 'diseased' ! ........]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The Sabah Forestry Department has issued a furious press statement claiming as &ldquo;<strong><em>false</em></strong>&rdquo; Sarawak Report&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/12/illegal-logging-in-sabah-by-the-state-government/">article</a> detailing how logs have continued to be extracted from the Sabah Forest Industries (SFI) licence area, despite a court order that this should immediately cease on November 8th.</p>
<p>Yet, in the very same statement attacking Sarawak Report, the Conservator of Forests acknowledges that timber IS STILL BEING EXTRACTED, giving the excuse that they are merely removing &lsquo;diseased&rsquo; Acacia trees infected with<em> Ceratocystis manginecans fungus.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>The timbers extracted from the area are all plantation Acacia trees planted in the ex-SFI area (the former titled land) and are being removed and destroyed because they either dead or infected with Ceratocystis fungus.</em>&ldquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Therefore, by their own admission, the report was in fact correct. Whether there is a viable excuse is a separate matter which raises&nbsp;immediate questions, the first being did the state government raise this matter of infectious fungus with the court at the time they were ordered to cease activities within the licence area and thereby seek an exemption to remove the &lsquo;diseased trees&rsquo;?</span></p>
<p>If not, why not and does that not mean exactly what we reported which is that they are illegally logging the area in defiance of a court order?</p>
<figure id="attachment_53867" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53867" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53867" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/12/pImg_f8d096b5295525efe4bbdc20ed61693c.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="422"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53867" class="wp-caption-text">27th November &lsquo;diseased&rsquo; timber is delivered for export, according to Sabah forestry statement</figcaption></figure>
<p>The second question is what consultation and information have they provided for the local people and indeed the receivers who are managing the area about this problem of disease control?</p>
<p>The press release complains that SFI had not informed the state government (which seized the land in 2021) that trees were diseased. Yet, what action has the state government itself taken to alert interested parties following their own discovery?</p>
<p>Sarawak Report has made its own enquiries as to the above and we have been informed that the first the plaintiffs who gained the court order on behalf of SFI heard about these &ldquo;diseased trees&rdquo; was AFTER the state government and its allies lost in court and were ordered to stop logging on November 8th!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The first time SFI heard about this allegation of diseased trees was in a parliamentary answer on behalf of the chief minister on November 20th AFTER the court order to cease&nbsp;activities. There has been nothing from any biologist, nothing from the state forestry department, no report concluded or customs declaration&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;one person informed by the plaintiffs has told Sarawak Report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Till this day, the informant has confirmed, there has been no information provided about this alleged disease and it certainly was not brought before the court in an application to except the alleged diseased area from logging.</p>
<p>Indeed, we can now inform that SFI will be lodging an affidavit to the court to protest at the violation of the court order to cease logging.</p>
<p>So, shame on the Sabah Forestry Department for coming out with such an attack against correct reporting when its own actions appear so severely lacking!</p>
<p>The concern does not stop there. &nbsp;The photographs received by Sarawak Report of the activities last Friday November 21st clearly show logs being trucked OUT OF THE area and then loaded onto barges for shipment. All on the excuse, we learn, that this timber is &lsquo;diseased&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Indeed, the forestry department&rsquo;s own press statement again ADMITS this exportation of diseased timber, boasting that the state coffers have thereby benefitted from export taxes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The State Government (via Sabah Forestry Department) has already collected a export and other royalties through Yayasan Sabah&rsquo;s efforts.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is Sabah forestry department boasting about exporting what we now learn at their own admission are diseased logs?</p>
<p>If these trees have been cut because they are diseased, as claimed, ought they not be destroyed on site to prevent a spread of this contagious condition?</p>
<p>Our information is that the advertised destination for these logs is Bintulu in neighbouring Sarawak, where Yayasan have a contract to supply fuel to the Press Metal aluminium smelter plant.</p>
<p>If so, where is the quarantine and the correct procedure to prevent the spread of this disease to Sarawak?</p>
<p>Given the apparent state of affairs, the people of Sabah, Sarawak and indeed well beyond are also owed an answer to a widespread suspicion that the transported logs (which actually look to be a tall and healthy size) could be sold on at a higher grading than mere charcoal production.</p>
<p>If that is the case, what assurance can be provided that these &lsquo;diseased&rsquo; logs are not being exported on to other countries for other purposes &hellip;. disease and all?</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than attacking Sarawak Report and claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;the article is <em>&ldquo;completely false and without basis&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>the Sabah state government should clearly and with urgency lay out the exact details as to what infected wood has gone where and since when.</p>
<h3><strong>&ldquo;Lost Jobs and Homes&rdquo;</strong></h3>
<p>The statement equally attacks Sarawak Report for suggesting the state government has failed to properly take care of the SFI worker who lost their employment on lands they seized. &nbsp;Some 2,000 workers used to live in Sipitang along with their families &ndash; a community of 6,000, say local campaigners for the rights of these people.</p>
<p>Last year, in a parliamentary interchange, the chief minister is on record telling the opposition leader that the state had tired of funding these workers&rsquo; salaries and that these former employees had to start to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, why is it &lsquo;<strong>false&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;to state, as we did in our article, &ldquo;<em>the dependent communities of former staff have been cut off from financial support</em>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Equally, why is it<strong> &lsquo;false</strong>&lsquo; to say they continue to be deprived of electricity and water which the state government have cut off from the settlement?</p>
<figure id="attachment_53868" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53868" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53868" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/12/pImg_08f66974b3854c4ef84ace03919baf4d.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="422"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53868" class="wp-caption-text">&lsquo;Re-appointed&rsquo;? sparse job opportunities</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sarawak Report asked local spokespeople whether salaries and services have been returned to the diminished number of hard core poor who struggle to continue to live in the settlement and we have been told they have not.</p>
<p>Indeed, the SFI receivers did attempt to fund a reconnection with SESB and agreed terms. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;the state government refused to allow the reconnection. Last year the same Sabah&nbsp;state government attempted to carry out an eviction order on these remaining families, only to retreat in the face of public protest.</p>
<p>It is clear, say activists, that the the purpose for cruelly withholding services is to try and drive these people away by other means.</p>
<p>Again, the state government statement admits all of the above by boasting that Yayasan Sabah has:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<strong>re-appointed</strong> 198 ex-SFI employees to work with them, <strong>who initially lost their jobs and homes.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The statement then laughably claims this &ldquo;<em>again contradicts the Sarawak Reports assertion that the land acquisition has taken away jobs from ex-SFI workers</em>&ldquo;, when in fact it is an admission!</p>
<p>As anyone can read, the above statement CONFIRMS that these people <strong>had lost their jobs and homes. &nbsp;</strong>What it unfortunately fails to acknowledge is that 198 re-appointments is just a fraction of the jobs lost &ndash; people and their dependants who are no longer receiving paid employment or able to live in homes without access to water.</p>
<p>Local activists say they believe the job figure boasted of is actually far less than the number currently employed.</p>
<p>So, instead of beating the messenger, Sabah forestry department should look to its actions and provide due transparency. Few believe that Yayasan has only logged out 2,000 ha, as claimed, since laying hands on the area in 2022. &nbsp;So, they should unlock the gates and allow proper access to the region for doubters to check and, moreover, provide a full report on the recently disclosed fungus that they are now using as their excuse for ignoring a court order to vacate the area.</p>
<p>As Sarawak Report has <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2023/09/more-of-sabah-up-for-cheap-sale/">previously reported,</a> a well known West Malaysian billionaire businessman, Syed Mokhtar,&nbsp;had originally agreed to pay SFI&rsquo;s receivers a market price of RM1.2 billion for the licensed area and had put down 10%.</p>
<p>Yet, after the new GRS government took office, these pledges were withdrawn as new strategies came into play. The first move was for the state government to compulsorily acquire the forest concession instead &lsquo;for a public purpose&rsquo;, which appeared to be to hand it to Mr Mokhtar without having to pay the market price after all. Indeed, the &lsquo;settlement&rsquo; offered instead was RM256 million, little more than the tenth already paid.</p>
<p>SFI&rsquo;s receivers have contested that Mr Mokhtar is not a &lsquo;public purpose&rsquo; and that the confiscation order has the appearance of seeking to abuse state power to grant a crony businessman for free what he had originally agreed to pay for &ndash; something that looks remarkably like a form of authorised theft.</p>
<p>It is on this basis of this argument the stay has been ordered until there is a judicial review of the state government&rsquo;s actions in this case.</p>
<p>The state government meanwhile, in an answer to another parliamentary question has now said it is NOT giving the license to Syed Mokhtar after all. Rather, as the latest press statement confirms, the future exploitation of the area is planned to take place by Yayasan and &ldquo;its private sector partners&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Three private companies have so far been disclosed by the state government in this respect. Sources have told Sarawak Report that all three are owned by one to two dollar companies set up in West Malaysia by entities under the control of none other than Syed Mokhtar!</p>
<p>So, little progress there?</p>
<p>This is a matter that is now due for decision by the courts who have ordered activities cease until such time. Why blame Sarawak Report for reporting it?</p>
<p><strong>update: 4th December:<br>
</strong>Yayasan/company workers manning the loading jetty and gate houses into the logging area rejected &nbsp;a copy of the sealed court order requiring operations cease that was presented to them, claiming it was &lsquo;not valid&rsquo;.<br>
They also claimed the other party had misunderstood the court order that clearly instructs that operations must cease.<br>
One local activist told Sarawak Report <em>&ldquo;They also said that if we want them to vacate the entire SFI area, we need to meet with the state government because they will only follow the state government&rsquo;s instructions. This implies that the law in Malaysia is now truly disregarded&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>So it seems, as we pointed out in our <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/12/illegal-logging-in-sabah-by-the-state-government/">previous article</a>, the state government appears to consider itself above the laws it is tasked to enforce on others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Sabah forestry department statement:</strong></h3>
<p><em>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</em><br>
<em>False Claim on ex-SFI Concession Area by SarawakReport</em></p>
<p><em>2nd December 2024, SANDAKAN &ndash; Following the report released by SarawakReport yesterday [1st December 2024] entitled &ldquo;Illegal Logging in Sabah! (By the State Government)&rdquo; the Sabah State Government, through its own Statement today denying the whole report and found it to be deliberately false and misleading.</em><br>
<em>On September 1, 2021, the Sabah Government cancelled the SFI timber concession due to the company&rsquo;s financial failure and cessation of operations -SFI under the receivership of Grant Thornto Consulting Malaysia Sdn Bhd ceased operations in 2016.</em><br>
<em>The revocation of the licence was made in the public interest, and SFI was subsequently wound-up by its creditors, including Sabah Development Bank Bhd., in November 2021 on the grounds that it was unable to pay its debts.</em><br>
<em>The Sabah Government later compulsorily acquired 15 plots of land amounting to approximately 12,000 hectares from the insolvent SFI under the &ldquo;Sustainable Forest Resource Utilization, Processing, Management, Conservation Research, and Development Scheme, District of Sipitang&rdquo; (the &lsquo;Public Interest Scheme&rsquo;). The acquisition process was completed in August 2022.</em><br>
<em>Yayasan Sabah group was then appointed to implement the Public Purpose Scheme with the assistance of the Sabah Forest Department. This strategic initiative aims to conduct forest timber research and development, to sustainably manage, develop, and replant and sustainable exploit native forests, forest plantations, and timber resources within the Sipitang District, and to focus on reforestation and the manufacture of value-added timber products.</em><br>
<em>Prior to the State Government&rsquo;s acquisition and while the acquired lands were under the care of SFI / Grant Thornton, the Acacia Mangium tress became infected with Ceratocystis manginecans fungus. This was not previously disclosed by Grant Thornton and was discovered by the Sabah Forest Department.</em><br>
<em>The timbers extracted from the area are all plantation Acacia trees planted in the ex-SFI area (the former titled land) and are being removed and destroyed because they either dead or infected with Ceratocystis fungus.</em><br>
<em>Permission to log and extract these dead or infected Acacia trees was given to Yayasan Sabah (YS), whereby tree harvesting process needs to be expedited to remove those plants infected with the Ceratocystis fungus. This must be carried out immediately to prevent the spread of infection in other areas, and to allow planting of new trees to be carried out subsequently. These new trees, among others will be studues as part of the research and development part of the Public Purpose Scheme.</em><br>
<em>As of to date, logging has been carried out in an area of approximately 2,039 hectares and Yayasan Sabah will carry out replanting in the area with a planting cost of approximately RM12,000 per hectare.</em><br>
<em>The Sarawak Report&rsquo;s allegation that &lsquo;&hellip; timbers were flushed out without paying the proper dues, and in the process, the dependent communities of former staff have been cut off from financial support&rdquo; is completely false and without basis.</em><br>
<em>The State Government (via Sabah Forestry Department) has already collected a export and other royalties through Yayasan Sabah&rsquo;s efforts. Apart from that, Yayasan Sabah has also re-appointed 198 ex-SFI employees to work with them, who initially lost their jobs and homes. This again contradicts the Sarawak Reports assertion that the land acquisition has taken away jobs from ex-SFI workers.</em><br>
<em>The State Government is also pleased to announce significant progress in the implementation of the &ldquo;Sustainable Forest Resource Utilization, Processing, Management, Conservation Research, and Development Scheme&rdquo;, following following investment commitments estimated at RM4 billion over the next 10 years through Yayasan Sabah and its private sector partners.</em><br>
<em>This will include research and development of hybrid Acacia and other fast-growing, disease-resistant natural forest (NF) and plantation timber (ITP) species. In addition, the scheme also seeks to support local community by creating job opportunities through the sustainable downstream exploitation of NF and ITP timber for the people of Sipitang and is expected to generate up to 3,000 job opportunities for the Sipitang District, revitalizing and strengthening the local economy.</em><br>
<em>This project aligns with the Sabah State Government&rsquo;s policy to develop 400,000 hectares of statewide Industrial Tree Plantation (ITP) areas within the next decade, focusing on high-value wood products for export and technology transfer to the people of Sabah.</em></p>

      <title>Illegal Logging In Sabah! (By The State Government)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[The courts have ordered that the state government must cease logging the Sipitang forest until the outcome of a review of its compulsory acquisition of the area. Yet, in defiance of the ruling, the Yayasan controlled timber operation is working as fast as it can to strip out more wood........ ]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>In case anyone in Sabah is still labouring under the misapprehension that the law applies to the law makers themselves, the sickening sight lines of logging trucks pouring out of Sipitang laden with illegal timber over the past few days will sadly disabuse them.</p>
<p>There has been a long-running dispute in the area that has impacted terribly on the inhabitants of Sipitang who had settled as employees of the previous Sabah Forest Industries (SFI) which became &nbsp;insolvent.</p>
<p>Predator buyers have since sought, with the assistance of the GRS state government, to flush out the timber without paying the proper dues, according to the receivers of the company, and in the process the dependent communities of former staff have been cut off from financial support as well as services such as electricity and water.</p>
<p>This callous treatment has been a <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2023/09/more-of-sabah-up-for-cheap-sale/">long running shame</a> on the Sabah state government which has denied any responsibility for the welfare of these desperate former workers whilst seeking to lay hands on the timber.</p>
<p>After years, during which the state government has sought to confiscate the licence in favour of its own operators under the Yayasan foundation in the name of &lsquo;public interest&rsquo;, the courts have ruled against such moves.</p>
<p>On November 8th the <a href="https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/733482">Court of Appeal granted a stay</a>&nbsp;to the SFI receivers who have been seeking a just settlement in the face of a compulsory acquisition of the area by the state government in the name of the &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; when there wasn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>It is that compulsory acquisition which has now been stayed pending&nbsp;the determination of a judicial review application.</p>
<p>Lawyers for those acting on behalf of SFI say this order passed by the court is very clear in that it prohibits further exploitation of the area by Yayasan Sabah to stop logging the area under the excuse of the compulsory confiscation which is no longer viable.</p>
<p>On 11th November they issued a Notice to the defendants in the case, namely the state government and its officers to <em>&ldquo;vacate the said Lands, cease all activities, including logging, extraction of timber logs and or removing the same from the said Lands&rdquo;</em> and to remove all agents, employees, workmen, machinery, vehicles and equipment.</p>
<p>This was in accordance with the Order of the Court which it quotes saying that all further activities must be stayed on the land pending the application for a judicial review</p>
<p>However local campaigners have taken numerous evidential pictures to show that the Yayasan operation to strip out as much of the timber as it can as fast as possible has continued despite that order.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53854" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53854" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/12/pImg_0043c8ba06339a538e16962e6830a453.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="422"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53854" class="wp-caption-text">Loading barges</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sarawak Report has seen pictures dated Friday 27th November that document a vast scale of continuing activity with offices open and management staff occupying the area whilst logging continues. Fleets of transportation vehicles continued on that day to extract the now illegal timber and bring it to the port where heavy cargos were loaded for export.</p>
<p>Of course, the same Sabah government has a stunning track record when it comes to allegations of graft and scandal, so such behaviour will surprise nobody when there is money to be made.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53856" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53856" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/12/pImg_d6205182bc6a3276ab116ce9fbd33e0d.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="422"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53856" class="wp-caption-text">Offices still open and gates still manned by Yayasan interlopers</figcaption></figure>

      <description><![CDATA[The wife of the Sultan of Terengganu has issued her demand for the cash awarded to her by the Malaysian courts of RM435,000 against this site and both a printer and distributor in KL whose businesses would be threatened if unable to pay......]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The wife of the Sultan of Terengganu has issued her demand for the cash awarded to her by the Malaysian courts of RM435,000 against this site and also a printer and distributor in KL whose businesses would be threatened if unable to pay.</p>
<p>This judgement owed to an initial error in the book<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>The Sarawak Report</em>&nbsp;(published in 2018) that cited the &lsquo;wife&rsquo; of the Sultan rather than the &lsquo;sister&rsquo; of the Sultan in the sentence corrected below:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Jho was also friendly with a key player in Terengganu, the sister of the Sultan&nbsp;whose acquiescence was needed to set up the fund, and he later cited her support as having been crucial to his obtaining the advisory position.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The error was immediately acknowledged and corrected and an apology made that it was the sister and not the wife who had known Jho Low.&nbsp;However, a demand for a payment of RM300 million was sent to the three defendants if the Sultanah was not to proceed with her action.</p>
<p>The editor of Sarawak Report maintains the statement was not defamatory, most particularly given the sister of the Sultan plainly did nothing wrong in making such an introduction. The matter was touched on in the book in that it formed part of the series of events at the Terengganu Investment Authority that later led to the formation of 1MDB (the federal development fund at the heart of the narrative).</p>
<p>The High Court had likewise ruled that the judge could see no defamatory meaning in the sentence. However, the Sultanah pursued an appeal and the Appeal Court, in a transformative interpretation of how meaning should be decided, concluded that some readers with the benefit of hindsight of Jho Low&rsquo;s later crimes&nbsp;might come to conclusions that would lower their opinion of the subject.</p>
<p>That interpretation holds chilling implications for those seeking to write about matters of public interest in Malaysia.&nbsp;The Appeal Court also held the author responsible for remarks made by members of the public on third party media sites about the litigant after the suit was launched (there had been no public comment about the litigant in advance of the suit).</p>
<p>The Federal Court declined to hear the case, ruling that the wife of the Sultan has as much right <em>&ldquo;as any member of the public&rdquo;</em> to pursue an expensive libel suit. However, in rejecting the further appeal the Federal Court nonetheless conceded that <em>&ldquo;the significance of the [Sarawak Report] book cannot be underplayed</em>&rdquo; in terms of exposing matters of public interest.</p>
<p>The wife of the Sultan complained while giving testimony in court that Sarawak Report had used her &lsquo;name&rsquo; in the above sole reference in order &ldquo;to sell the book&rdquo; which covers the author&rsquo;s years-long (unpaid) investigation and expose of the world record kleptocracy of the 1MDB scandal.</p>
<p>The author has engaged in this Malaysian litigation, even though the book was written in English and published in the UK, to keep in solidarity with the local businesses who were also targeted owing to Malaysia&rsquo;s oppressive publication laws. We have found no British legal authority of the view this case could likely have succeeded in London.</p>
<p>Sarawak Report is therefore immensely grateful to the very many Malaysian citizens who have already over the past few months clubbed together to raise the lion&rsquo;s share of the money to be paid to the wife of the Sultan and to those who have pledged to raise the rest.</p>
<p>We are sad this burden has been placed yet again on ordinary Malaysian people who have struggled to support freedom of the media to expose crimes such as 1MDB and to write about matters in the public interest. &nbsp;Malaysia should be proud of its hardworking citizens who have supported Sarawak Report and the country&rsquo;s own free media in its brave role in holding criminality in high places to account &ndash; criminality which has held the country back.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The wife of the Sultan has said that she will donate this money that has been raised by citizens in her country to support needy Muslim charities in her state. &nbsp;Given the wealth of Terengganu and its royal household demonstrably great</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">, we hope it will further match this sum raised by ordinary Malaysians in their own disbursement to such good causes.</span></p>

      <description><![CDATA[In mainland Malaysia when flooding strikes the federal and state governments rally to help the stricken victims.  However, five days after Long Panai was submerged in Mulu, Baram the Sarawak State Government and local GPS representatives appear to have done nothing and have yet to show their face......]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p style="font-weight: 400;">For the past five days the people of Long Panai in Baram have struggled to battle terrifying flood waters that have risen above the stilts of their longhouses to wash into their living quarters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And what of their Baram MP Anyi Ngau and their Mulu YB Gerawat Jala, themselves &nbsp;both safely ensconced in their luxury homes in Kuching?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;<em>We have heard nothing &nbsp;from either of them. Our rice supplies and fresh water are running out</em>&rdquo; confirmed one retired teacher who managed to reach one of the few arms of the media who seem ready to report on such matters, Radio Free Sarawak.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So, once again, the people of Baram have been deserted by those supposed to represent them but who have turned hirelings instead for the loggers who control GPS, which has in turn stepped up the relentless quest to strip out every last piece of saleable timber in this remaining forested region of the state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53811" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53811" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53811" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/10/pImg_6e6d8ba01e851aeb6f0913889d6b62ea.png" alt="" width="400" height="342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53811" class="wp-caption-text">New Sarawak Tribune 10/10/24</figcaption></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just yesterday, as these villagers were sinking under the waters of a river that now swells regularly beyond its traditional boundaries thanks to the effects of that logging and to accompanying climate change, the Taib family owned Sarawak Tribune, reported that the State Government has decided that it wishes to pull out of the internationally supported Upper Baram Forest Area Project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Forest Department of Sarawak is quoted as having announced its request for the termination of the project at a meeting of the Steering Committee owing, it said, to &ldquo;ongoing challenges and disruptions in project implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Those challenges would appear to include the angry objections by locals and international sponsors of the project about recent illegal logging in the area (using unlicenced immigrant workers) which the above Forest Department has been condemned for doing nothing about.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the companies involved in this destruction an area supposedly protected by an agreement between the ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organisation), the Sarawak Government and NGOs who have funded the project through voluntary donations, have <a href="https://sarawakreport.org/2024/09/borneolands-illegal-workers-how-come-no-action-against-hii-family/">proven to have links to powerful timber barons.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Sarawak Report enquired whether European partners were aware about the Forest Department&rsquo;s latest bid to cancel the protected area (funded largely by them) it was clear they had been given no warning of the decision. &nbsp;So nothing new there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Back down stream, the residents of Long Panai are well aware that the forest clearances and increasingly hot weather that is bringing storms are behind their problems. This is the 7<sup>th</sup> such flood the village has experienced&nbsp; over the last year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53815" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53815" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53815" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/10/pImg_47a6f0853868eb37a1912ba775fac390.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="225"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53815" class="wp-caption-text">After five days no help has arrived from the state government or federal services</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, there had still been no sign of help and another villager, John Bara, spoke to the radio station to express his concerns. He confirmed&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">the long houses in the Batang Baram Main River have not yet been flooded, but the 2 tributaries of Baram, Tinjar and Tutoh, are currently flooded, namely Long Panai (Tutoh River) and Long Loyang (Tinjar River). </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In general, floods are becoming more frequent. Floods, landslides and unusually heavy rains have become a new phenomenon in Baram. We the people of Baram believe that it is due to massive logging for over 5 decades, coupled with commercial oil palm plantations and sand mining along the Baram river. For example in Long Ekang (Peter Kalang&rsquo;s longhouse) landslides along the river bank toppled the Long Ekang church and now Long Ekang&rsquo;s longhouse is just waiting to be washed away by landslides. This all happened because of human greed. The solution &ndash; stop logging and also stop granting commercial palm oil licenses. Long Ekang is a clear example. There is extensive sand mining and palm oil plantations up to the longhouse area &ndash; it is worked by the Pelita Ekang Banyok plantation company &ndash; in collaboration with the villagers. Maybe the villagers will get money. But their longhouses were submerged/washed away by mud floods/collapses and soil erosion. I appeal to the government to help the flood victims, because the people are watching you. The people will judge you during the election&rdquo;.</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Those in Long Panai are now resigned to the fact that owing to the regular uncontrolled swelling of the river caused by logging, dredging and climate change their village needs to be moved in its entirety to higher ground.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53817" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53817" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53817" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/10/pImg_03022895360135f2c29b13ff81ed3214.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="301"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53817" class="wp-caption-text">Taking refuge upstairs</figcaption></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">They have begged their representatives to help find the funds from the state government that ought to be dripping in wealth accrued from the very logging that has destroyed their homes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, not only has that proposal been ignored, nothing is being done to meet the immediate needs of the local people in this disaster.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The local teacher, Madeline Jok, who said she was standing up to her knees in water as she made the call to RFS, complained that none of the village know the whereabouts of YB Gerawat from whom they have still heard nothing during their plight of the past five days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;He curried support at the last election to gain his victory, but when we&rsquo;re in this kind of trouble, he doesn&rsquo;t appear at all. Three blocks of long houses in Long Panai with 132 doors are currently flooded on the ground floor and residents have had to drag their goods upstairs. If the water rises again. We don&rsquo;t know where to run.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;<em>There is no heart to help us&rdquo;</em>, the schoolteacher observed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53818" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53818" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53818" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/10/pImg_b607314f214ebaf3c8e995b504e01f83.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="565"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53818" class="wp-caption-text">Living quarters swamped</figcaption></figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers have filmed their plight and have managed to Whatsapp the material out to show the extent of their plight, which <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/VWQuXrHS79eiJkwo/?">supporters have placed on Facebook.</a> So far they have heard nothing back.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fleets of transport and rescue helicopters available to the bigwigs of the GPS political class have plainly had better matters to attend to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;We request YB Gerawat, the welfare department and related parties to come and send us food aid. Because in a little while our rice supply will run out. Not only were our lives threatened, our livestock and farms were flooded. In peninsular Malaysia when there is a flood disaster. Aid is quickly received and cash aid also given to residents to ease the burden of flood victims.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">was the parting plea from the villagers&rsquo; broadcast on <a href="https://radiofreesarawak.org/">Radio Free Sarawak</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-53819" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/10/pImg_97355d0efb4cb04c018fa64168cff585.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="565"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, the truth, as everyone knows, is that the loggers who are eyeing the remaining timber of Baram want nothing more than to see the pesky native people who seek to live there disappear under the waters of the rivers they have caused to swell.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And it is those loggers who pay the election expenses of the GPS party and those absent local representatives.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[The pro-democracy NGO Engage has generously supported this site, as well as the publishing house Gerabudaya and printing house Violin, who were all sued for a hundred million ringgit each by the Sultanah of Terrenganu. We are now only RM150,000 short of our total target......]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The campaign to curb the cost of free speech, thanks to outdated defamation laws, is well underway in democratic countries where libel actions are recognised as a weapon for the rich and powerful to intimidate those who question (or even mention) their affairs.</p>
<p>In Malaysia the balance is all the more unequal, given the continued use of criminal defamation (abolished elsewhere) and hierarchical society.</p>
<p>When the Sultanah of Terengganu first came after the editor of this site, Malaysian law allowed the printer and distributor of her book in Malaysia to be sued as well.</p>
<p>The complaint was that the book <em>The Sarawak Report</em> had, in a single sentence, mistaken the Sultanah for her sister in law, as the person whom the 1MDB fraudster, Jho Low, had identified as having introduced him to her husband who was the chairman of the Terengganu Investment Authority.</p>
<p>The Sultanah&rsquo;s legal suit demanded RM100,000,000 (one hundred million ringgit) to be paid by each of the three defendants &ndash; the author, printer and distributor &ndash; a total of Rm300 million.</p>
<p>If she did not receive this sum of cash within 8 days, together with fulsome apologies, her lawyers threatened, they would drag all three into court. The author was protected in the UK, however the Malaysian businesses were not.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the cash was not forthcoming. However, the writer did immediately acknowledge the error that it was the sister of the Sultan, not the wife, whom Jho Low had cited &ndash; something that has never been denied.</p>
<p>The sister is a qualified businesswoman who was on the board of one of Jho Low&rsquo;s companies and also the TIA itself. Jho Low was clearly proud to tell <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/07/30/low-dispels-talk-he-received-rm500mil-airbase-job">The Star newspaper in an interview&nbsp;</a>in 2010 that this valued royal business connection had smoothed the path to his appointment as an advisor to the TIA.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Q: How did you get to know the Yang di-Pertuan Agong?</p>
<p>A: His Majesty&rsquo;s sister Tunku Datuk Rahimah introduced us. She is the chairman of Loh &amp; Loh Corporation Bhd, whom I met as a fellow shareholder of Abu Dhabi-Kuwait-Malaysia Investment Corporation (ADKMIC). &nbsp;[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/07/30/low-dispels-talk-he-received-rm500mil-airbase-job]</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The author apologised for the misidentification, issued erratum slips for the existing copies of the book&nbsp;and corrected the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; to &lsquo;sister&rsquo; on page 3 in an immediate new imprint of her 500 page narrative of the 1MDB scandal.</p>
<p>However, the author was not prepared to accept that the error was defamatory of the Sultanah nor to accept any of the meanings that the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers sought to ascribe, namely that:</p>
<figure id="attachment_53797" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53797" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53797" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_8266a9e1f6df63c429c352566ee31553.png" alt="" width="750" height="507"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53797" class="wp-caption-text">Pleading by the Sultanah of Terengganu</figcaption></figure>
<p>After all, to have agreed that this was the meaning of her words would have been to besmirch the sister of the Sultan of Terengganu who has never denied that she did perform the introduction and who was herself on the board of the Terengganu fund (chaired by her brother the Sultan and then Agong of Malaysia).</p>
<h3><strong>Drawing Meaning</strong></h3>
<p>It is an unfortunate aspect of libel cases that they tend to draw attention , often in an unfortunate way, to matters better left unexaggerated and forgotten.</p>
<p>Such common sense judgement acts as one of the few restrictions in place to deter the super wealthy and super influential from conducting unrestrained libel actions against folk who do not have the matching finances to defend themselves, let alone to pay up huge sums to prevent such cases from reaching court.</p>
<p>The original Malaysian High Court judgement in this case in fact accepted there was no libel. The judge agreed that the above claims about the meaning of the sentence were exaggerated and that there was no shame in having recommended Jho Low in 2008 to be an advisor to the TIA.</p>
<p>He had seemed a respectable figure at the time.</p>
<p>The author did not mention the royal introducer by name or refer to her again at any other point in the 500 page book. &nbsp;The case appeared over.</p>
<p>However, an appeal was demanded by the litigant who also succeeded in reopening a parallel criminal &nbsp;prosecution (four years after it was initially shelved) in 2020. &nbsp;This criminal prosecution was moved to the home state of the royal litigant.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Appeal Court judges eventually ruled the High Court judge had erred in not being more avid for scandalous connotations when he read the words that himself had found to be innocuous.</p>
<p>Sarawak Report&rsquo;s refusal to apologise sufficiently was described as a further factor.</p>
<p>The Federal Court has refused to take the case further, leaving the freedom of writers severely impaired in Malaysia compared to other countries where the courts have a far stricter limitation on what can be considered defamatory and leave that interpretation to the judge. [<a href="https://www.carruthers-law.co.uk/our-services/defamation/determination-of-meaning/">see&nbsp;Koutsogiannis v The Random House Group Ltd [2019]</a></p>
<p>Sarawak Report, the distributor Gerakbudaya and printer Vinlin are therefore now facing a ruling to pay the Sultanah RM300,000 in damages plus a total of RM155,400 in related costs.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a thousand times less than what the plaintiff was demanding in order to drop the case in the first place. &nbsp;However, as with so many defamation cases, it is a punishing sum for those who dared open their mouths and report on Malaysia&rsquo;s largest corruption scandal, namely 1MDB.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the defendants are also indebted to their own lawyers, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/americk-sidhu-0314b632">Americk Sidhu</a>&nbsp;and also <a href="https://www.tommythomas.net/main/home/index">Tommy Thomas Advocates Malaysia</a>, who for several years have undertaken this case pro bono (for free) in the belief that they should defend a &lsquo;scandalous claim&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Had not these Malaysian lawyers stood up for the three defendants, the bills demanded against them would have at least doubled.</p>
<p>Malaysian and global democrats have also rallied.</p>
<p>Thanks to their defence lawyers as well as Engage, The Centre for Independent Journalism and other civil society supporters in Malaysia and also to donors from the UK and beyond, the three defendants have managed to raise all but RM150,000 of the costs demanded by the Sultanah and her legal team.</p>
<p>Every generous contribution from the public has helped make the crucial difference between bankruptcy and survival for the two brave businesses in Malaysia.</p>
<p>If we join forces to raise the rest it will help those have stood up for a free media in Malaysia to survive another day and it will help Sarawak Report to continue to inform Malaysians about issues such as 1MDB and the many other concerns raised on this site.</p>

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>The NGO Human Right Watch has, in collaboration with other international organisations, today issued a devastating <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2024/09/Human%20Rights%20Watch_Submission%20to%20the%20European%20Commission_May%202024.pdf">report</a> on Sarawak&rsquo;s timber industry as it urges the European Union to categorise all Sarawak products as &ldquo;High Risk&rdquo; in advance of new laws to counter deforestation.</p>
<p>The critique follows on the heels of last week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=460293313656880&amp;set=pcb.460293933656818">arrest of illegal immigrants</a> found working for Borneoland Timber Resources in Baram, after both the Sarawak Forest Department and Malaysian Chief Executive of the International Tropical Timber Organisation had for months<a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/09/borneolands-illegal-workers-how-come-no-action-against-hii-family/"> ignored complaints</a> of logging by the crony company in the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">Suling Sela&rsquo;an Protected Forest</span>&nbsp;area.</p>
<p>A joint statement to the <span style="font-size: 16px;">European Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans, and Fisheries&nbsp;</span>by&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">Human Rights Watch, RimbaWatch, SAVE Rivers, KERUAN, Bruno Manser Fonds, and The Borneo Project&nbsp;</span>explains:</p>

<p>Under Malaysia&rsquo;s federal form of government, individual states have jurisdiction over the administration of land and forests&hellip; we have concluded that the state of Sarawak has not effectively enforced measures to tackle deforestation and protect human rights, and it has not made relevant data available. Its legal framework has failed to uphold Indigenous peoples&rsquo; rights to own and control their land, participate in decision-making, and access important information that impacts their rights and livelihoods. Where laws and standards do exist, they have rarely been enforced.</p>
</div>

</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">

<p>The report follows a year long study into Sarawak&rsquo;s failings which focuses on the stunning lack of transparency over the granting of concessions combined with failures of basic consultation of native communities that stand out even in Malaysia:</p>
<blockquote><p><span lang="EN-US">&ldquo;Unlike other states in Malaysia, Sarawak does not require public participation in the elaboration of environmental impact assessments.

</span><span lang="EN-US">Moreover, &nbsp;&ldquo;Sarawak&rsquo;s current land code imposes insurmountable obstacles for Indigenous communities to gain and maintain title to their ancestral lands, while effectively allowing companies to ravage the rainforest.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US"><span lang="EN-US">The EU anti-deforestation law should factor in Sarawak&rsquo;s dismal track record in its benchmarking process. &lsquo;High risk&rsquo; is the only reasonable classification.&rdquo; &nbsp;[</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 17.600000381469727px;"><a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/luciana-tellez-chavez">Human Rights Watch</a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 17.600000381469727px;">]</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The EU is due to enforce the so-called EUDR regulations (<span style="font-size: 16px;">European Union Deforestation-Free Products) next year. Under the EUDR </span><span style="font-size: 16px;">the Commission will designate countries or parts thereof as under the categories of <em>&ldquo;low, standard,</em> or <em>high risk</em>&rdquo; by December 30, 2024, based on the likelihood of being compatible with the regulations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">EU companies importing these products would also have to </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/19/eu-major-step-deforestation-free-trade">conduct </a></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">more rigorous due diligence to mitigate environmental and human rights risks.

<p>According to the very limited information available (for which both Malaysia and EU countries are culpable, according to Human Rights Watch) EU countries are amongst the top buyers of Malaysian timber and the 3rd largest market for Malaysian palm oil.</p>
<p>The report says that Malaysia is one of five countries that account for the lion&rsquo;s share of <em>&lsquo;tainted timber&rsquo;</em> imported into Europe, together with&nbsp;C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Brazil, Indonesia and Ghana. &nbsp;Much of that wood is being plundered from Borneo where the NGOs point out monitoring and assessments are abysmal.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span style="font-size: 16px;">Forest management in Sarawak is overseen by the state&rsquo;s Forest Department, which lacks a real-time deforestation monitoring system. Ad-hoc assessments that the federal government has published produced deeply questionable results. For example,.. it reported 845 hectares of forest land converted to cropland in 2019, in contrast with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 17.600000381469727px;">120,000 hectares of naturally regenerating forest loss recorded by Global Forest Watch that year.50</span></p>

<p>Recently, the minister of natural resources, environment, and climate change said that &ldquo;generally, the total forest area is obtained from legal gazettement notifications,&rdquo; which means that any land gazetted by state governments as forest and subjected to the National Forestry Act are considered &ldquo;forest cover.&rdquo;&nbsp;This includes timber plantation concessions, meaning that the 2.4 million hectares of predicted deforestation caused by the expansion of timber plantations will not affect the &ldquo;forest cover&rdquo; numbers reported by the Malaysian government.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 16">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment, and Climate Change estimated forest cover in 2017 at 18.3 million hectares, or 55.52 percent of the country&rsquo;s total land area. However, in 2020, Malaysia reported to the FAO that forest cover stood at 19.2 million hectares instead. &nbsp;Such inconsistencies add to the concern that Malaysia&rsquo;s monitoring and reporting of its own forest resources is unreliable.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government restricts access to any geospatial data related to its forest cover reporting, meaning that it does not share information about where forests actually are, RimbaWatch found. Maps of timber concessions are outdated and do not consider new areas zoned for plantations. Further, maps are not commonly available on Forestry Department websites, and there is no publicly available list of Environmental Impact Assessments for Sarawak. <strong>The Malaysian Palm Oil Certification Council said it would publish maps of oil palm concessions in Malaysia in 2019 but has yet to do so.

<p>It is for the above reasons that the NGOs have declared that the much questioned Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme [MTCS] should be treated as an unreliable and unrecognised standard.</p>
<p>This is the certification that Sarawak has mandated for its logging concessions as part of its highly publicised &ldquo;green policy&rdquo;. &nbsp;However, the report says that:</p>

<p>Local and international civil society organizations,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 17.600000381469727px;">have identified serious deficiencies in the MTCS certification process that have allowed companies to effectively deforest with impunity. These systemic weaknesses include a lack of transparency from auditors, absence of a functional grievance mechanism, and inability of the Malaysian Timber Certification Council (MTCC), which oversees MTCS, to suspend certification when anomalies are discovered. The MTCC is governed by a board of trustees that includes representatives from the Sabah Timber Industries Association and Timber Exporters&rsquo; Association of Malaysia. The MTCS has yet to introduce reforms that could address these criticisms.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>In summary, the certification process in Malaysia is dominated by the timber industry itself and once a concessionaire has obtained a certificate there is no mechanism to remove it whatever violations might subsequently take place!</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
<p>Malaysia has been lobbying frantically to prevent the implementation of the EUDR and Sarawak is spinning propaganda alleging green policies.</p>
<p>It is time to take proper steps to conserve what is left of Malaysia&rsquo;s high value forests; to stop pretending foreign acacia plantations are the same as natural forest cover; to adopt basic transparency and to stop abusing the rights of its native peoples so that certification claims can be tested and believed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sarawak and its timber companies with their now global reach remains listed as one worst deforesters in the world and destined to be categorised as &ldquo;High Risk&rdquo; for western markets from 2025.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[The ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organisation) and Sarawak Forestry Department have turned a deaf ear to complaints by NGOs and native communities about illegitimate logging in the conservation zone - the Penan Peace Park in Baram - funded by international donations and supposedly sponsored by both bodies. Last week the Immigration Dept raided the logging camp that turns out to have been operated by the state government crony Hii family and found at least 10 illegal immigrants working illegally ....]]></description>

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>It appears that Sarawak&rsquo;s timber tycoon Hii family has been hiring illegal Indonesian workers to conduct logging operations in the internationally protected area of Ba Data Bila in the Baram region which the Sarawak Forestry Department has denied were taking place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53760" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53760" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53760" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_47c7d43d0e9bf68442e74b42a11ecac8.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53760" class="wp-caption-text">Arrested by Immigration at the Log Camp</figcaption></figure>
<p>On September 11th, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=460293313656880&amp;set=pcb.460293933656818">notices by the Immigration Department</a>, a swoop on the area resulted in the arrest of 25 workers, 10 of whom have been detained for being illegal immigrants without work permits.</p>
<p>Strangely, although the earlier&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theborneopost.com/2024/07/10/no-massive-logging-activity-being-done-in-upper-baram-region-says-forest-dept/">denials were blasted across the local media</a> (which is largely controlled by timber companies) there has been no reporting of this latest embarrassing development.</p>
<p>Since way back in June global environmental groups have <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/talkback/end-of-timber-politics-in-sarawak/#tab-1">raised the alarm</a> over the trashing of this supposedly protected forest area encompassed by the Penan Peace Park initiative in Baram.</p>
<p>This project has been funded by international contributions in support of native communities who have fought to save their forests and is officially sponsored and protected by the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO), currently chaired by a Malaysian national.</p>
<p>However, Sarawak&rsquo;s Forest Department and its director Datuk Hamden Mohamad <a href="https://www.theborneopost.com/2024/07/10/no-massive-logging-activity-being-done-in-upper-baram-region-says-forest-dept/">went on the record</a> to deny there was any organised logging in the remote area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53761" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53761" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53761" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_9f36ec367f9c0f07f3db8a56ac6cf65f.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="563"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53761" class="wp-caption-text">No timber camp, just some community works?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hamden was adamant the activity detected by villagers merely represented the rolling out of some &lsquo;community projects&rsquo; in the area as requested by the state appointed headman.</p>
<p>Tellingly, Hamden also told the Borneo Post that none other than the state premier (chief minister) Abang Johari had <em>&ldquo;agreed that the area be developed</em>&rdquo; and he criticised the Swiss NGO BMF for complaining that the conservation project, subsidised by international donors largely coordinated by themselves, was being undermined.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53762" style="width: 292px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53762" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_c309cb8db8da24212e46aac12dcbad4d.png" alt="" width="292" height="400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53762" class="wp-caption-text">Log Pond Licensee Borneoland Timber Resources Sdn Bhd</figcaption></figure>
<p>The &nbsp;Forestry Department continues to ignore all basic principles of transparency and accountability, like all Sarawak&rsquo;s government institutions, by refusing to make concessions and licences publicly available.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that a licence had indeed been given out has been made blatantly obvious by the presence of the mandatory sign which had been placed in the forest advertising exactly that!</p>
<p>It is known that licences had been offered to the notorious logging giant Samling in the past (owned by the Yaw family who have familial ties with Abang Jo).</p>
<p>However, when the international momentum grew to rescue this scarce remaining area of Sarawak jungle still largely un-destroyed by logging, Samling (which has numerous other interests funded by its early billion dollar profits) handed back the licence.</p>
<p>So, who is behind Borneoland Timber Resources? &nbsp;It takes little time to find out that the primary shareholder and director is Hii King Chiong, the current driver of the family company that has long ingratiated itself in the corridors of power based in Miri.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53763" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53763" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_fae5c6f28f24c96537973c75017b1c12.png" alt="" width="750" height="220"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53763" class="wp-caption-text">Hii King Chiong is the current patriarch of the Hii family empire</figcaption></figure>
<p>It was Hii that <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2011/02/taibs-entrepreneurship-in-miri-corruption-revealed/">got into business</a> with Taib&rsquo;s sister Raziah Geneid, handed huge chunks of land by the former chief minister in Miri. The family have a history of <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2013/03/billion-venture-vs-squatters-the-story-behind-the-hii-familys-ncr-land-grab/">controversial logging projects</a> supported by licences from the Taibs. &nbsp;Now it seems clear that Hii is likewise eager to present as a right hand presence for Abang Jo:</p>
<figure id="attachment_53764" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53764" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53764" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_8efd08c98bf8ea128d0511833e97bb6b.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="562"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53764" class="wp-caption-text">What kind of development did Abang Jo refer to?</figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in July the Taib family paper New Sarawak Tribune <a href="https://www.newsarawaktribune.com.my/premier-officiates-sjkc-chiaw-nan-opening/">featured Hii,</a> together with Raziah and Abang Jo at the opening of a Chinese school in Miri. &nbsp;If Abang Jo had called for the &lsquo;development&rsquo; of the villages of Ba Data Bila was it he who sanctioned the Forestry Department&rsquo;s transfer of the former Samling licence to Borneoland Timber Resources?</p>
<p>This weekend, a spokesman from the Bruno Manser Fund, which has painstakingly led the drive to protect the Baram forest area, scoffed at the claims by the Forest Department that this was not a logging operation. They sent pictures of timber trucks exiting the area:</p>
<figure id="attachment_53765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53765" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53765" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_ba2fa7a04d28e8aa146b6eed7394a181.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="338"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53765" class="wp-caption-text">Photographed near Ba Data Bila in recent days</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Immigration Department has now raided the camp and identified illegal workers who have been transported into the distant jungle to work on logging that plainly violates the terms of the protected area, asks the NGO, how is it only the impoverished and powerless foreign workers who are now being punished?</p>
<p>What will happen to those who hired them, namely the powerful Hii family who had ignored all protests against their activity together with the Forestry Department?</p>
<p>It was a police report lodged on behalf of native protestors by the PKR lawyer and local party leader Roland Engan which had at last drawn the attention of the federal law enforcers after studious refusals from the Forestry Department to become engaged.</p>
<p>Since June, the relevant officials have claimed to be too busy to reply to repeated letters from local NGOS. The same has applied to the Malaysian Director of the ITTO, <a href="https://www.itto.int/ittc-57/">Sheam&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">Satkuru.</span></a></p>
<p>This despite the large sums of foreign funding raised to underpin the project that is officially supported by the ITTO:</p>
<figure id="attachment_53766" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53766" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53766" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_0e2d5dc7ec605f31ff4772b2608171e1.png" alt="" width="750" height="516"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53766" class="wp-caption-text">Three letters went unanswered</figcaption></figure>
<p>A separate letter in August from residents of 15 Penan communities was also sent to Abang Jo, Mr Hii and Ms Satkuru and addressed to the Managing Director of Borneoland Timber Resources:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p class="PreformattedText"><span lang="EN-US">We, the undersigned community representatives from the villages of Ba Data Bila, Long Lamam and other villages in the Baram area protest and strongly object to the illegal logging activities carried out by the contractor Yaya Jaya Sdn. Bhd. (Yaya Jaya) on BLTR&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="PreformattedText"><span lang="EN-US">We are shocked by the large area of forest around Ba Data Bila village that has been cleared and devastated by Yaya Jaya&rsquo;s workers because that area is our customary primary forest.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="PreformattedText"><span lang="EN-US">2. The wooden sign board erected by your company clearly states that the logging operation belongs to BLTR and the logging activities undertaken by your contractor, Yaya Jaya.</span></p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN-US">Your employees have been at Ba Data Bila for several months now.&nbsp; They should be able to verify the devastation and state of destruction that has occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; BLTR is responsible for this significant large scale environmental damages that has and will affect our lives for a long period of time..&rdquo;</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div>&hellip;.. also failed to receive any reply.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Once again, the Forest Department has been seen to act in favour of timber cronies and misguided politicians &ndash; equally disgracefully the ITTO has failed to act as well. &nbsp;And once again, it is clear that in doing so these bodies have thereby condoned illegal behaviour and the destruction of the forests their department is charged with protecting.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(see how the Forestry Department has <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/07/new-logging-licences-for-cronies-whilst-natives-get-kicked-off-their-farms/">likewise oppressed native communities</a> in the Simalajau Agricultural Village, trampling on their official rights in the name of extending a National Park long since razed to the ground, whilst they turn a blind eye to the destruction of the genuine natural forest).</div>

      <description><![CDATA[The new Chairman of Britain's NatWest Bank has reportedly claimed he only spent 1-3 hours a week advising PetroSaudi. However, his own email said the job took up half his time and was his 'primary commitment" at the time of the PetroSaudi fraud against 1MDB .....]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Malaysian government sources have confirmed to Sarawak Report that the task force seeking the recovery of 1MDB assets seeks to examine the payments made to one of the key former operatives at PetroSaudi International following the jail sentences handed out to two directors of the company in Switzerland last month.</p>
<p>Rich Haythornthwaite, who has recently taken up the role of Chairman of Britain&rsquo;s major bank NatWest, still partially owned by the UK government, was paid a million ringgit a year (<em>&ldquo;$500k gross &pound;200k net&rdquo;</em>) backdated to 2008 according to a contract drawn up in 2010, after the 1MDB joint venture had poured an initial $300 million into the fledgling oil company.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;<a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2023/09/new-nat-west-chair-the-contract-that-wasnt-the-2m-bonus-he-did-not-receive-and-the-inappropriate-tax-avoidance-plan-he-suggested-but-was-never-executed/">final contract</a>&lsquo;, that matched several versions in the PetroSaudi database, further included two retention payments to be paid in due course totalling $2 million (c RM8 million at the time).</p>
<p>Haythornthwaite worked for the company for eight years thereby potentially earning some 16 million ringgit, although he has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/09/new-natwest-boss-rick-haythornthwaite-saudi-company-petro-saudi-1mdb">subsequently denied</a>&nbsp;that the bonus payments (apparently structured to avoid British tax) were actually made.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Company Player</strong></h3>
<p>As Chief Operating Officer, President and the stated Number three in the PetroSaudi International organisation chart, Rick Haythornthwaite played a key part in developing the company&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>The parent company was established in 2005 (according to its <a href="https://www.petrosaudi.com/en/">current website)</a> in Saudi Arabia but had no operating business before PetroSaudi International (UK) was incorporated in 2009.</p>
<p>Mr Haythornthwaite himself stated in an email sent to director Patrick Mahony in 2010 that he saw his role at PetroSaudi International as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Leading the development and success of our business operations, ranging from strategy formulation to deep tactical involvement (whatever it takes to move the business forward), including the development of organisational structure, systems and culture;&nbsp;Supporting Patrick Mahony in the new business development and expansion;&nbsp;Using my extensive business networks to source opportunities and facilitate business delivery;&nbsp;Leveraging my City and international reputation should we wish to access the public equity or debt markets;&nbsp;The attraction and recruitment of talent.&nbsp;Helping in every possible way to protect and enhance the PetroSaudi brand.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Correspondence and documentation also shows that Haythornthwaite was a driving force in the negotiations beginning in June 2009 to acquire a time limited option to enter a so-called Farm-in agreement with the Canadian company Buried Hill, which owned a potentially valuable oil concession in the Caspian Sea gained from Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>The negotiations were financed by a loan from the venture capital company Ashmore, where the now convicted Patrick Mahony was working at the same time as fulfilling the role of Chief Investment Officer at PetroSaudi.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53728" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53728" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_144e6537f047e9f3bdb45839db23cc22.png" alt="" width="750" height="466"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53728" class="wp-caption-text">Rick Haythornthwaite&rsquo;s official position at PetroSaudi alongside the now convicted Patrick Mahony and Tarek Obaid and Prince Turki (imprisoned in Saudi Arabia 2017)</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>The Caspian Oil Field Fraud</strong></h3>
<p>The project was fatally flawed, however, in that it was widely known that the Serdar oil concession belonging to Buried Hill lies in disputed territory. It has yet to be exploited.</p>
<p>A letter of agreement drawn up and sent to PetroSaudi colleagues by Rick Haythornthwaite in 2009 recognised the problem saying</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>It is acknowledged by the Parties&nbsp;that the Boundary Dispute could, despite all reasonable endeavours &hellip; give rise to circumstances in which the Parties&rsquo; ability to conduct Petroleum Operations under or relating to or arising from the Contract is compromised.</em>&ldquo;</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_53735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53735" style="width: 373px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-53735" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_acf0e4c1169fce0ebabec3e927c0da4a.png" alt="" width="373" height="400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53735" class="wp-caption-text">Malaysia to put in US$1 billion in the fund and&nbsp;PetroSaudi US$1.5 billion.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nonetheless, it was this option that was used by Patrick Mahony to obtain the <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2016/01/tarek-rated-petrosaudi-project-as-being-worth-zero/">$2.9 billion valuation</a> of PetroSaudi&rsquo;s assets that was presented to 1MDB as the basis for the joint venture into which the Malaysian fund invested $1 billion in cash.</p>
<p>The billion dollar cash &lsquo;investment&rsquo; was publicly announced in the Malaysian media at the time, and prime minister Najib Razak openly referred to PetroSaudi as having also contributed $1.5 billion &ndash; later briefed to newsmen as being in the form of its assets in the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>PetroSaudi&rsquo;s law firm White &amp; Case drew up organisation charts in the week before the announcement of the joint venture deal that featured the Turkmenistan &lsquo;holding company&rsquo; as the key $1.5bn asset brought by PetroSaudi into the JV (along with an Argentine venture that soon folded).</p>
<figure id="attachment_53730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53730" style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-53730" src="https://sarawakreport.org/wp-content/uploads/imgcache/2024/09/pImg_8e4ba19dc976b78db9d59936613888db.png" alt="" width="550" height="750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-53730" class="wp-caption-text">PetroSaudi&rsquo;s alleged injection of $1.5 billion was based on the valuation of the disputed Turkmenistan asset for which it merely had a time limited option to acquire 50%. As the valuation of that asset amounted to $2.9 billion (<a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2015/02/foreign-collaborators-jho-lows-key-supporters-and-the-money-they-made/">according to PetroSaudi&rsquo;s own valuer</a>) a further &lsquo;repayment&rsquo; of $700m was demanded and agreed to by 1MDB&rsquo;s negotiators.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet PetroSaudi never owned the asset behind that valuation. &nbsp;It merely had an option to buy a 50% share of the Buried Hill venture under terms that would have required PetroSaudi to then fund the hundreds of millions required to begin operations.</p>
<p>Those terms were made clear in the negotiated agreement drawn up by Rick Haythornthwaite which Sarawak Report has sighted.</p>
<p>Rick Haythornthwaite has denied that he had sight of the separate joint venture negotiations with 1MDB or that he was privy to the false claims of ownership being made by PetroSaudi.</p>
<p>Sarawak Report does not contest that denial.&nbsp;However, as the correspondence makes clear, Haythornthwaite was aware the Turkmenistan option was cancelled immediately after the Joint Venture was signed, meaning Malaysia had invested in a company with no active operations.</p>
<p>Indeed, the decision to cancel the contract was communicated to Ashmore by Patrick Mahony and PetroSaudi&rsquo;s lawyer the day after the 1MDB payment of $300 million to PetroSaudi was banked on 1st October 2009.</p>
<h3><strong>Well Run Small British Oil Company?</strong></h3>
<p>This week the NatWest Chair&rsquo;s press relations representative assured Sarawak Report&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Rick remains appalled by the criminal actions of directors at the PetroSaudi parent company. He also regrets being initially dismissive of the Sarawak Report&rsquo;s inquiries&hellip;.. Misconduct at the parent company level was not visible to Rick or to others at PetroSaudi UK. Indeed, it was actively covered up.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The statement continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is important not to mischaracterize the nature and work of PetroSaudi UK, which was a legitimate, well-run small oil company. It had, at various times, exploration and development projects in Turkmenistan, West Africa, Venezuela and Indonesia. It had compulsory compliance reporting and good staff. Rick helped to build this legitimate business, providing an advisory service in good faith.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarawak Report has questioned the rigour of such compliance, which failed to detect the fundamental deceit in the way PetroSaudi International was presented to 1MDB during the joint venture negotiations conducted in London through the lawfirm White &amp; Case.</p>
<p>It was the money defrauded from 1MDB that funded the entirety of PetroSaudi&rsquo;s future operations, including Rick Haythornthwaite&rsquo;s backdated contract with PetroSaudi International (UK).</p>
<h3><strong>Or Rag Bag Operation?</strong></h3>
<p>Despite to the above statement, Rick Haythornthwaite had described PetroSaudi very differently in December 2009, when he called it a rag bag of part timers rather than a well run company with a strong staff.</p>
<p>In an email to Patrick Mahony citing an &lsquo;Organisation Chart&rsquo; he&rsquo;d created to promote PetroSaudi to the Venezuelan government he said it&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;shows &lsquo;how we are developing&rsquo; rather than a rag bag of part timers.&nbsp;Try it on for size.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a further email sent to Mahony in 2010, Haythornthwaite referred to his &ldquo;<em>work with PetroSaudi in uncertain circumstances as an act of good faith &hellip;. recognising that the longer term structure still remains uncertain.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In fact, PetroSaudi had no active operations in Turkmenistan, Africa or Indonesia, and the Venezuela drill ship operation was funded with stolen 1MDB money.</p>
<p>Neither were there full time staff before 1MDB paid hundreds of millions in cash (now frozen) on which no returns were ever made.</p>
<p>This suggests a level of poor compliance and poor due diligence on the part of the senior, if part-time, staff of the British based company and the man who is now in charge of a major public bank.</p>
<h3><strong>No Questions Over The Missing $700?</strong></h3>
<p>This site has also <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2015/12/jho-low-is-confirmed-as-the-sole-shareholder-of-good-star-major-exclusive/">approached Rick Haythornthwaite</a> over his apparent failure to question the missing $700 million from the original $1 billion that was publicly announced by 1MDB as having been invested in the joint venture, given PetroSaudi itself only received $300 million.</p>
<p>As the above step chart shows, White &amp; Case were instructed just days in advance of the joint venture to execute a fictional $700 million loan from a Cayman Island subsidiary of PetroSaudi to the new 1MDB PetroSaudi (BVI) subsidiary &ndash; even before a company bank account had been created to receive it (see the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/877166/dl?inline">DOJ civil asset seizure</a> suit).</p>
<p>1MDB&rsquo;s management agreed days later to purchase 40% of 1MDB PetroSaudi (BVI) with the billion dollar payment on the understanding that $700 million of that cash would be used to &nbsp;&lsquo;repay&rsquo; the non-existent loan.</p>
<p>When he learnt what had happened the Chairman of the board of 1MDB very publicly resigned. All this was <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/us-700-million-diverted-another-010038324.html">public from July 2015</a>.</p>
<p>The loan device was later <a href="https://theedgemalaysia.com/article/arul-are-you-sure-petrosaudi-owned-good-star-when-us700-million-was-paid">spun</a> as having been executed in recognition of the superior value of the assets injected by PetroSaudi into the JV.</p>
<p>However, not only did those assets did not exist but the $700 million did not go back to PetroSaudi but rather to a Seychelles company called Good Star Limited which belonged to Najib Razor&rsquo;s proxy, Jho Low.</p>
<p>Sarawak Report exposed this theft in <a href="https://sarawakreport.org/2015/02/heist-of-the-century-how-jho-low-used-petrosaudi-as-a-front-to-siphon-billions-out-of-1mdb-world-exclusive/">February 2015</a> and by March no less than four Malaysian task forces had been set up to investigate.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the growing chorus from early 2015, PetroSaudi operatives could hardly have failed to notice that since the very inception of the joint venture in 2009 there had been persistent concerns raised in Malaysia about 1MDB&rsquo;s missing money from this joint venture.</p>
<p>The fund had changed auditors three times amidst inordinate delays in producing audits, the Chairman of 1MDB and board members had resigned, the fund was billions of dollars in debt and its supposed profits had been secreted into a Cayman Islands vehicle named Brazen Sky, that was opaquely concealing its financial situation behind a non-market based self valuation of its own &lsquo;units&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yet, 1MDB and the director of PetroSaudi, Tarek Obaid, continued to <a href="https://theedgemalaysia.com/article/arul-are-you-sure-petrosaudi-owned-good-star-when-us700-million-was-paid">confirm in 2015 that Good Star Limited was a subsidiary of PetroSaudi,</a> thereby implying that the 2009 loan had been indeed received by the company as part of the valuation negotiations around the joint venture.</p>
<p>When Sarawak Report <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2015/12/jho-low-is-confirmed-as-the-sole-shareholder-of-good-star-major-exclusive/">requested if Mr Haythornthwaite could confirm</a> this claim, instead of doing so he accused this site of &ldquo;questionable activities&rdquo; in raising concerns about the venture and said that even if he could help in our enquiries he would not do so.</p>
<p>We therefore question whether his above claims of strong compliance and indeed due diligence amount to the level expected of the head of one of Britain&rsquo;s most respected banking institutions?</p>
<p>We also question the claim that he was merely working for the British based arm of PetroSaudi International. In fact, all the proposed ventures set up under his management, including the one operational venture in Venezuela using money stolen from 1MDB, were conducted through a web of off-shore companies controlled not by PetroSaudi International (UK) but by the Cayman parent company.</p>
<p>In an email discussing his proposed delayed &lsquo;retention fees&rsquo; of $2 million Haythornthwaite again <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2023/09/new-nat-west-chair-the-contract-that-wasnt-the-2m-bonus-he-did-not-receive-and-the-inappropriate-tax-avoidance-plan-he-suggested-but-was-never-executed/">suggested off-shore instruments </a>to hold the money and even appeared to suggest PetroSaudi might choose to send him to work abroad at the time these were due for payment.</p>
<p>This Coutts Bank (a key subsidiary now of NatWest) &lsquo;bond wrapper&rsquo; device would give the appearance of being a method of avoiding tax. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/09/new-natwest-boss-rick-haythornthwaite-saudi-company-petro-saudi-1mdb">In a reply to the Guardian</a> Mr Haythornthwaite has said the proposal &ldquo;<em>would not have been considered appropriate&rdquo;</em> and denied it was put into practice. &nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t remember having suggested it.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Sarawak Report asked the top businessman whether, given these apparent failings and the now proven criminality of the company he played such a key role in presenting as a respectable brand, would he now offer to return those earnings to Malaysia?</p>
<p>After he failed to reply Sarawak Report made enquiries and received a confirmation that the 1MDB asset recovery taskforce is seeking information leading towards a potential suit against Mr Haythornthwaite.</p>
<p>Mr Haythornthwaite has also failed to respond to our question whether he will make a formal apology to Xavier Justo, a former colleague and PetroSaudi director, whom he failed to support after PetroSaudi International colluded in imprisoning him in Bangkok in an attempt to silence his whistleblowing over the 1MDB fraud?</p>
<h3><strong>I regard PetroSaudi as my primary commitment</strong></h3>
<p>The Financial Times last week <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80832480-84fb-40c2-a147-d6baf093ceba?accessToken=zwAGIYOmcPkwkdOAgySAhPtAwtOhR9a68JPOug.MEUCIFNxMAkySQmDZBiINyKLSW_VMZ8HLqb7l2b5hhvDu-7PAiEAyxpIU7BTbmaK-tMKPhPRZZuBmt2sYzMwqobMm14YZb4&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=6e907db1-e0c9-4dd9-a613-9f3f4f3ae3de">reported</a>&nbsp;that Rick Haythornthwaite had explained, when questioned by NatWest, that his connection to PetroSaudi (now erased from his CV) was minimal during the 8 years of his lucrative employment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Haythornthwaite told NatWest he worked as a part-time adviser for a UK subsidiary of PetroSaudi for just one to three hours a week between 2008 and 2016, according to people familiar with the discussions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This would indeed have rendered his fees to have been astronomical.</p>
<p>However, new documents have since emerged with would appear to confirm otherwise. They include a letter from Mr Haythornthwaite to the now convicted Patrick Mahony, sent in March 2010, in which he gives a very different description of his job and the hours worked in the course of demanding a formal contract from the now wealthy company thanks to the funds from 1MDB:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At present, I am receiving $500,000 pa gross (ca &pound;200,000 net) for a commitment of two days a week with the potential for a bonus payable over and above this base amount, at the discretion of the &lsquo;the Board&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I regard PetroSaudi as my primary commitment and have endeavoured to be available whenever the role dictates &ndash; as a result, I have spent considerably more that 2 days per week on PSI business and would expect to so do in future&hellip;.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have enjoyed and been happy to work with PetroSaudi in uncertain circumstances as an act of good faith and that good faith has been reciprocated.&nbsp; The time has arrived when we both feel that a more appropriate package should be established, recognising that the longer term structure still remains uncertain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives me the opportunity to request a package that reflects my personal objectives and circumstances.&nbsp; My hope is that is works for both of us.&nbsp; Its realisation would, from my perspective, elicit a bond of loyalty, energy and commitment that promises to go well beyond a simple employer-employee relationship&hellip;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed components are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will make an average of between 2.5 and 3 days per week available to PetroSaudi, distributed to accommodate the needs of my other roles. This will include a pre-defined 60 days a year when I am available to travel on PetroSaudi business &ndash; my 2010 and 2011 diaries have already identified these days. As hitherto, I will always try to accommodate travel request that sit outside theses pre-defined days&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter then goes on to outline the requested terms of the payment contract which was drawn up as described above.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[YB Snowdan Lawan and his GPS colleagues must start by naming and shaming those behind the Balai Ringin disaster and opening a full open inquiry into how it was allowed to happen....]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p>Another shocking log jam has afflicted the interior of Sarawak, this time in Sungai Krangan, Balai Ringin.</p>
<p>On this occasion, at least, there have been no <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/03/log-jam-what-log-jam-sarawaks-director-of-forests-should-consider-his-position/">attempts to pretend that logging and plantation activities</a> are somehow not to blame.</p>
<p>After the catastrophe developed yesterday the&nbsp;Natural Resources and Environment Board (NREB) moved to make a<a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/09/03/natural-resources-board-fines-company-over-balai-ringin-logjam-in-sarawak-orders-immediate-river-cleanup/149095"> swift statement confirming</a> <em>&ldquo;The incident, which was caused by uncontrolled bulldozing and land clearing by a plantation company, has led to significant environmental and socio-economic impacts.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the NREB reported to the media that the company responsible has already been identified, reprimanded, fined and tasked with the clean up &nbsp;&ndash; all within just 24 hours!</p>
<p>In case that might appear to be a rather suspiciously hasty opening and closing of the case the NREB went on to assure that it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;conducting a thorough investigation to determine if there are any additional violations within the buffer zones. If additional violations are found, we will initiate an investigation and legal action will be taken against the responsible parties, including bring them to court for prosecution,&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst is may be progress that environmental criminals are being at last identified by the state government and ostensibly held to account, such&nbsp;behind closed doors handling of the affair is simply not good enough.</p>
<p>The afflicted community, and indeed the whole of Sarawak, are entitled to know the identity of the company concerned, the nature of the licence they received, how it has been judged they violated the terms of that licence, what the fine they have received was and under what protocols that fine was determined.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the matter of compensation for affected victims of this disaster, which they can hardly &nbsp;pursue if the episode is treated like some sort of secret.</p>
<p>In a properly run, democratic state (which Sarawak claims to be) all logging and plantation licences should be openly published and available from the Land &amp; Survey Department, together with all the terms and conditions, royalties paid and directors and shareholders responsible.</p>
<p>This would be following, of course, a full and transparent licensing process to include environmental assessments, community consultation and legal scrutiny as to competing land rights &ndash; all of which would also be readily available to the public.</p>
<p>However, in Sarawak such matters are treated as deadly secret. &nbsp;A decade ago a leaked copy of the <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2011/03/we-release-the-land-grab-data/">relevant land data</a> did happen to fall into the hands of this site. &nbsp;That data immediately explained the reason for the secrecy.</p>
<p>Time and again concessions had been handed out for peanuts to political cronies and relatives who went on to make billions of ringgit of personal profit out of the destruction of Sarawak&rsquo;s public lands.</p>
<p>So, who are the concession holders involved in this particular incident who are now admitted to have violated whatever terms they were required to abide by? &nbsp;Why the silence on that matter?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2012/05/bns-bratpack-boys-snowdan-lawan/">local sports car enthusiast YB, Snowdan Lawan,</a> has chipped in to protest at the failings of this &nbsp;mystery entity, so presumably he knows what has been going on. &nbsp;Why has he not provided a full statement to his constituents?</p>
<p>All this secrecy has inevitably produced a great deal of highly warranted criticism and informed speculation as to what may well have happened in an area, where logging and plantation has been actively underway without anyone beyond &lsquo;those in the know&rsquo; having any clue whether the destruction was sanctioned or not.</p>
<p>The venerated Iban rights activist, Nicholas Mujah from the local NGO SADIA, gave his own take on the situation to <a href="https://radiofreesarawak.org/">Radio Free Sarawak</a> on Tuesday, pointing out that many plantation licenses are handed out simply as an excuse for companies to come in and take the timber from an area:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plantation companies often take the opportunity to sell the logs from the designated plantation area. Some companies apply for permits to establish oil palm plantations just to gain access to areas for logging. After the trees are cut down, the areas meant for palm oil cultivation are sometimes left abandoned. [RFS summary]</p></blockquote>
<p>Nicholas Mujah goes on to suggest, according to the interview, that the above situation is common due to widespread corruption among representatives in Sarawak. The forest department and the oil palm plantation companies bribe village heads and their bosses to keep them from reporting these environmental crimes.</p>
<p>The current fines range from RM30,000 to RM150,000, depending on the size of the contaminated area, he said. However, such fines are negligible compared to the environmental damage caused and the substantial profits from selling logs in the designated plantation areas, which can reach tens of millions of ringgit.</p>
<p>Snowdan Lawan and officials at the NREB need to come forward to assure Sarawakians that this element of corrupt practice has not been active in this case. They have admitted that this clearance has been unauthorised and destructive, therefore the full details of who was given permission to do what under which legal grounds needs to be published.</p>
<p>The police &ndash; and indeed SPRM &ndash; should be brought on to the investigation immediately also, given the utter failure of the forest department and NREB to control the situation so far.</p>
<p>Were the state parliament ever allowed to sit (which of course it barely ever does) Mr Snowdan Lawan ought to be required to explain what has been going on in his area and why he didn&rsquo;t notice the logging up till now.</p>
<p>Likewise, he should be able to quiz some of the <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/08/malaysias-deputy-environment-minister-still-profits-from-logging-native-lands-with-special-exemptions-also/">logging tycoons</a> who simultaneously pose as Environment Ministers in Sarawak why proper controls have not been actively in place?</p>
<p>It seems that the leadership in Sarawak has at least grasped that in order to queue up for the economic benefits that can accrue from environmental good practice &ndash; i.e. through certification schemes, carbon credit projects and offsetting &ndash; green credentials are required.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to simply boast about being green and <a href="https://www.sarawakreport.org/2024/08/sarawaks-lip-service-only-eco-policies/">claim progress on reforestation</a> when the facts do not bear out those claims.</p>
<p>Lack of transparency and corruption behind closed doors spell inevitable failure for any attempt to implement genuine green policies or achieve credibility in the green markets of the future.</p>
<p>Snowdan Lawan and his GPS colleagues must start by naming and shaming those behind the Balai Ringin disaster and opening a full open inquiry into how it was allowed to happen.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Allegedly,  onlookers are wowed and impressed by Sarawak's 'green' policies, including for hydrogen, tree planting, carbon capture and the rest.  Yet, right now, what is going on is not green in the least. Less greed and more genuine concern for good governance is needed to drive these plans.......]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">According to <a href="https://www.theborneopost.com/2024/08/31/abg-johari-swaks-advanced-green-policies-captivate-leaders-at-asean-australia-business-forum/">his own PR,</a> delegates to an Asian Green Energy Conference have been hugely impressed by Abang Jo&rsquo;s &lsquo;visionary&rsquo; plans for creating &lsquo;Green Hydrogen&rsquo; and achieving &lsquo;Carbon Capture&rsquo;.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">People who understand science and who do not have a vested interest in dam building or the fossil fuel industry can offer a different perspective that ordinary folk should urgently be made aware of.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Specifically, the use of hydropower (building dams) to create hydrogen is NOT green in the way you might argue using wind or solar power is green, first because it destroys rivers that are vital to our habitat and second because in the process of destroying rivers you pour green house gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">This means that before you can start to use any hydrogen created by the energy from a dam you have already created a mass of green house gas emissions that you cannot balance out.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The Sarawak government also apparently hopes, together with the fossil fuel industry advisors who are behind the scheme, that it can lead the world in the dodgy new technology of stuffing carbon back into the holes under the sea that have been created by all the oil and gas extraction of yesteryear.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">If this goes wrong which it is bound to), you could <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/comment-carbon-capture-storage-is-dangerous-distraction-its-time-imagine-world-2023-12-11/">face eco-catastrophe</a> on the scale of a nuclear power plant meltdown.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Western scientists might like to suggest Borneo as a good place for that to happen (distant for them) while they experiment on the technology&hellip;&hellip; Would not nature&rsquo;s own tried and tested solution be so much more acceptable i.e. the mass re-planting of Borneo&rsquo;s own natural carbon absorbing trees?</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Why should Sarawak be used to belch out gases to create hydrogen for export, so that places such as Tokyo and Seoul can boast about low emissions from their own vehicles without counting the actual cost in terms of destruction and emissions elsewhere?</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">We all live in the same atmosphere and it&rsquo;s heating up.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">As Save Our World Rivers was plainly not invited to inform the audience at this latest &lsquo;Green Energy&rsquo; Conference attended by Abang Jo, we attach their incisive article on the subject which ought to be read by any decision maker in the field and by every voter in Sarawak.</p>
<h4 data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><span class="wpex-text-3xl"><strong>Why Hydropower Can&rsquo;t Produce Green Hydrogen</strong></span><br>
[From <a href="https://savetheworldsrivers.org/world-rivers-update-why-hydropower-cant-produce-green-hydrogen/">Save our Rivers &ndash; Gary Wockner&nbsp;</a>]</h4>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Over the last two years, I&rsquo;ve watched &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; make a splash as the Next Big Thing in the energy field. It was promoted at the <a href="https://events.climateaction.org/transition-summits/hydrogen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>U.N.&rsquo;s COP27</strong></a>, and is currently promoted by <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221028005095/en/AltaSea-White-Paper-Details-Benefit-of-Sustainable-Green-Hydrogen-Market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>NGOs</strong></a> and some of the <a href="https://www.siemens-energy.com/global/en/offerings/renewable-energy/hydrogen-solutions.html?n/offerings/renewable-energy/hydrogen-solutions.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">biggest energy corporations in the world</a>.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;ll give a quick summary of what Green Hydrogen is. Second, I&rsquo;ll describe why hydropower can never produce it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Green Hydrogen?</strong></p>
<p>Hydrogen is one of the most plentiful elements on Earth and in our atmosphere, and it burns easily and hot. That hydrogen is one of two key elements in all water on the planet (&ldquo;H2O&rdquo;), it has great appeal as an abundant energy source. Further, when hydrogen is burned, it only produces water, and doesn&rsquo;t produce any greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).</p>
<p>As such, although hydrogen has been an energy source for well over 100 years, it has recently gained more attention as a major &ldquo;low carbon&rdquo; fuel of the future. Further, because hydrogen burns hot, it is considered a replacement for burning fossil fuels in high-heat industrial and transportation processes that cannot be easily replaced by other forms of renewable energy.</p>
<div class="captioned-image-container"></div>
<p>Several methods exist to produce hydrogen including one of the simplest which is &ldquo;electrolysis&rdquo; which extracts hydrogen from water, a process that requires electricity. When that electricity is created using renewable energy, and then used to extract and produce hydrogen, that hydrogen is said to be &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; (read more details simply stated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>here on Wikipedia</strong></a>).</p>
<p>So-called renewable electricity sources including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower* (caveat, see below) are often the main types of electricity discussed that can power electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. When renewable energy sources are used to generate the electricity that extracts hydrogen, the overall GHG footprint of producing and burning hydrogen can decrease dramatically to become a very low-carbon form of energy.</p>
<p><strong>Why Can&rsquo;t Hydropower Produce Green Hydrogen?</strong></p>
<p>Although all energy sources have an environmentally negative footprint and create some amount of GHGs, I always argue that <strong>hydropower has one of the biggest environmentally negative footprints of all energy sources</strong>, including fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Almost all forms of hydropower are created by building a dam to block a river and store water in a reservoir that is later run through turbines to create electricity. There are many types of hydropower (briefly discussed later), but every form of hydropower has very negative environmental impacts with dam/reservoir systems being the worst.</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dams block rivers including fish migration, sediment movement, debris flow, nutrient flows, and water,</li>
<li>Dams slow rivers which changes the ecology, water temperature, sediment, and habitat of rivers,</li>
<li>Dams almost always make water quality worse by hugely changing the hydrological cycle of a river,</li>
<li>Dams can cause the extinction of fish and aquatic life,</li>
<li>Dams can make flooding in rivers worse,</li>
<li>Dams exacerbate coastal flooding, beach erosion, and sea level rise by blocking sediment/debris flow and changing the hydrological cycle of rivers,</li>
<li>Dams can increase disease in humans due to unnaturally flooded landscapes,</li>
<li>Dams are hugely expensive and create &lsquo;sunk costs&rsquo; scenarios that preclude constructing other less environmentally damaging forms of energy production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second and finally</strong>, almost all hydropower systems that use dams and reservoirs create greenhouse gas emissions that make climate change worse. Hydropower dams create GHGs in three principal ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deforestation &mdash; across the planet, billions of acres of land have been deforested to make way for dams and reservoirs, including over 6 million acres in one country, Quebec, alone. These forests are often cut and burned in huge waste piles (which emits CO2), and these forests no longer sequester carbon.</li>
<li>Surface Emissions &mdash; when organic material that exists in a reservoir, or flows into a reservoir, decomposes under water, it produces methane. Surface emissions are the biggest source of GHGs in dam/reservoir systems.</li>
<li>Downstream Dewatering &mdash; when wetlands, mangroves, and riparian areas downstream of a dam are dewatered, they dry up and emit CO2 and methane.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some dam-and-reservoir hydropower facilities produce as much, or more, greenhouse gases as a coal-fired powerplant generating the same amount of electricity (see this <a href="http://savetheworldsrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tell-The-Dam-Truth.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>presentation posted here</strong></a>, and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY6osmSEPiw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>short video posted here</strong></a>). Further, various federal agencies in the U.S. &mdash; <a href="https://www.epa.gov/air-research/research-emissions-us-reservoirs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>including the EPA</strong></a> &mdash; have studied, and are continuing to study, the full extent of GHG emissions that are produced by dams and reservoirs.</p>

<p>Although there are various types of hydropower schemes &mdash; including dam/reservoir, run-of-the-river, pumped storage, and others &mdash; they all have negative environmental impacts. Further, although large dams are worse than small dams, a sequence of small dams on a river can be just as environmentally harmful as one large dam. Finally, although so-called &ldquo;closed loop pumped storage&rdquo; hydropower projects often do have negligible impacts on rivers, they can have huge negative environmental impacts on landscapes, public/private property, and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it may make sense to use wind and solar to create electricity to drive electrolysis to produce &ldquo;green hydrogen&rdquo; as an alternative energy source. In fact, one presentation at COP27 was titled, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqn56IXc5_I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Pathways to a climate-friendly and fair green hydrogen economy</strong></a><strong>&rdquo;</strong>, and provided some promising ideas to achieve those goals. Further, the environmental organization Earthjustice produced an excellent report titled, &ldquo;<a href="https://earthjustice.org/features/green-hydrogen-renewable-zero-emission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Reclaiming Hydrogen for a Renewable Future: Distinguishing Fossil Fuel Industry Spin from Zero-Emission Solutions</strong></a>&rdquo;, that is worth a read.</p>
<p>However, rivers are &ldquo;<a href="https://www.synchronicityearth.org/rivers-overlooked-and-undervalued-allies-in-the-age-of-the-climate-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>overlooked and undervalued allies in the age of climate crisis</strong></a>&rdquo;, such that I never see an opportunity for hydropower to produce hydrogen that can ever be called &ldquo;green&rdquo;.</p>
