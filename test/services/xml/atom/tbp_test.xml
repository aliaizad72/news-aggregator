<p>KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 5): A young artist from Borneo is transforming discarded polyester plastic into stunning textiles, blending tradition and sustainability in his Kenyalang Circus exhibition.</p>
<p>Marcos Kueh, 29, a Chinese-Malaysian based in the Netherlands, is showcasing his vibrant creations at the National Art Gallery.</p>
<p>His designs combine fluorescent threads with cultural narratives, inspired by his roots in Malaysia and Borneo, as well as the chaotic beauty of street advertisements and multinational brand logos.</p>
<p>“Growing up, I was surrounded by plastics and stories about how they often end up in Malaysia. This project reimagines these materials, turning waste into something beautiful,” he said during a media preview of the exhibition in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Kueh said plastics are collected, recycled into yarns in Europe and woven into textiles.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is a major focus in Europe, and we aim to use fully recycled materials,” he added.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225342" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225342" class="size-full wp-image-1225342" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/FW1438941_KL43_05122024_BALAI_SENI-lpr.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225342" class="wp-caption-text">Kueh&#8217;s designs combine fluorescent threads with cultural narratives, inspired by his roots in Malaysia and Borneo, as well as the chaotic beauty of street advertisements and multinational brand logos. &#8211; Bernama photo</p></div>
<p>The project, which began in 2016 as a graphic design collage during his studies, evolved into a textile venture after he learned weaving in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>His work also delves into post-colonial narratives.</p>
<p>“Before paper and pen, people in Sarawak wove their stories into textiles. I find it romantic to bring that tradition into the modern world, weaving today’s stories into fabrics for future generations,” he added.</p>

<p>SIBU (Dec 5): A 33-year-old police sergeant pleaded not guilty in the Magistrates’ Court here today to five charges of cheating a senior citizen out of over RM500,000.</p>
<p>Philip Luney made the plea before Magistrate Romario Jonoi after the charges under Section 420 of the Penal Code were read to him by a court interpreter.</p>
<p>The Section provides for between one and 10 years in prison and caning, as well as a fine, upon conviction.</p>
<p>He is charged with cheating a 66-year-old man by deceiving the latter into handing over a total of RM523,650 on the promise that the money would be returned.</p>
<p>The alleged offences took place on Oct 18, Oct 31, Nov 10, Dec 13 and Dec 29 in different locations here.</p>
<p>The magistrate fixed pre-trial case management for Feb 3, 2025 and allowed Philip to be released on undeposited cash bail of RM10,000 with two local sureties.</p>
<p>Deputy public prosecutor Aiman Zarith Zahrullail handled the prosecution, while counsel Yap Hoi Liong appeared for the accused.</p>

<p>GEORGE TOWN (Dec 5): There will not be any major changes in the economic relations between the United States (US) and Malaysia under the new leadership, said US Ambassador to Malaysia Edgard D Kagan.</p>
<p>Although the exact details of the US new administration’s policies will not be known until January 2025, he is confident that the economic relations, which generate tremendous benefits for people in both countries, will continue.</p>
<p>“I think it is also fair to say that the exact details of policies are not really going to be known until the new administration takes over.</p>
<p>“At the same time, I think that it is very clear, and this has been true from both candidates (US presidential), that there is a strong desire to increase manufacturing jobs in the US,” he told reporters after delivering his remarks on the economic partnership between the US and Malaysia at the Penang Institute here, today.</p>
<p>Kagan stated there is an effort to look for a mix of policies to do that.</p>
<p>“I think that that is very, very clear that is going to be an important goal for the incoming administration, based on what they have said during the campaign,” he added.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, is set for a historic second term as the US president after defeating Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris in the race for the White House.</p>
<p>Trump’s official swearing-in is scheduled for Jan 20, 2025, at the US Capitol in Washington.</p>
<p>Kagan noted that the US-Malaysia two-way goods trade increased by 29.1 per cent in 2024, and if this trend continues, Malaysia will likely become the US’s third-largest trading partner in the Asean region.</p>
<p>“The growth is not just about the numbers, but what really matters is the strengthening ties, the broader trust and cooperation, the broader partnership between American firms, Malaysian firms, but also other multinational companies that operate in Malaysia and the American partners to whom they export,” he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that US investments have created nearly 312,815 jobs in this country, and Malaysia’s exports to the US also grew by 19.1 per cent this year.</p>
<p>“What we see is that the US exports to Malaysia play a crucial role in supporting the Madani Economy by providing Malaysian-based businesses with advanced technology and manufacturing capabilities, which enables Malaysia to produce more sophisticated and advanced products, moving up the value chain,” he added.</p>
<p>Touching on Malaysia’s imports of capital goods from the US, the ambassador said the top growth in imports for 2024 is aircraft components, aerospace equipment, semiconductor and wafer manufacturing equipment and electronic integrated circuits.</p>
<p>Kagan also highlighted the strong US-Malaysia economic ties, citing over RM150 billion worth of foreign direct investments since 2021.</p>
<p>The US is Malaysia’s second-largest export market. &#8211; Bernama</p>

<p>SEPANG (Dec 5): China and Malaysia must enhance communication and coordination on international and regional issues, firmly support one another, oppose protectionism, and promote trade and investment liberalisation, said Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia, Ouyang Yujing.</p>
<p>He said as important representatives of developing countries and emerging economies in Asia, both nations should advocate for an equitable and orderly multipolar world and inclusive and mutually beneficial economic globalisation.</p>
<p>Ouyang also emphasised the need for reforms to improve the global governance system, safeguarding international fairness, justice, and the shared interests of developing countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amid the global economy&#8217;s slow recovery, the digital economy and green development are gradually becoming new drivers of economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against this backdrop, China-Malaysia economic and trade cooperation is progressively moving into new fields and advancing toward higher quality development,&#8221; he said in his speech at the launch of the &#8216;Assessing the Roles of Chinese Enterprises in Malaysia&#8217;s Economic Development&#8217; report here today.</p>
<p>Also present to co-launch the report was Human Resources Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong.</p>
<p>The report was jointly published by the China Enterprises Chamber of Commerce in Malaysia (CECCM) and the Southeast Asia Research Centre for Humanities (SEARCH).</p>
<p>Ouyang further said that to achieve economic growth in the future, the digital economy and green development would represent two key trends, aligning with the high-quality development of a green &#8220;Belt and Road&#8221;.</p>
<p>He invited the Malaysian government and business community to participate in the Global Digital Trade Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, in September to explore new opportunities for collaboration in the digital sector.</p>
<p>For green investment cooperation, the ambassador encouraged companies to focus on areas such as clean energy, new energy vehicles, green finance, and green infrastructure construction.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this significant milestone marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia, I firmly believe that in the years to come, entrepreneurs and business communities from both nations will continue to uphold the spirit of China-Malaysia friendship—&#8217; overcoming obstacles hand in hand,'&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2023, he noted that China&#8217;s annual direct investment flow into Malaysia nearly quadrupled, surpassing US$2 billion (US$1=RM4.44) in 2023.</p>
<p>As of the end of September 2024, he added that China&#8217;s cumulative investment stock in Malaysia exceeded US$19 billion, making it a leading source of investment in Malaysia for many years, particularly excelling in manufacturing sector investments. &#8211; Bernama</p>

<p>MUMBAI (Dec 5): India on Thursday successfully launched into space a pair of European satellites that will create artificial solar eclipses to help scientists catch a rare glimpse of the Sun&#8217;s mysterious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Scientists broke into rapturous applause at the Sriharikota launch site as the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief announced the spacecraft had been ejected as planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spacecraft has been placed in the right orbit,&#8221; ISRO chief S. Somanath said.</p>
<p>The launch, originally scheduled for Wednesday but delayed by a technical fault, was for the European Space Agency&#8217;s &#8220;Project for On-Board Autonomy 3&#8221; (Proba-3) mission, part of a series of &#8220;in-orbit missions to test out new technologies&#8221;.</p>
<p>The mission, at a cost of 200 million euros (US$211 million), creates artificial total solar eclipses by positioning two satellites 150 metres apart from each other.</p>
<p>The shadow cast by one satellite allows the other to observe solar phenomena while blocking out the light from the Sun itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;For six hours at a time, it will be able to see the Sun&#8217;s faint atmosphere, the corona, in the hard-to-observe region between the Sun&#8217;s edge and 1.4 million kilometres from its surface,&#8221; the European Space Agency said in a pre-launch analysis.</p>
<p>The project will help scientists answer key questions, including why the corona is so much hotter than the Sun itself, and how the Sun&#8217;s energy output changes over time.</p>
<p>India has emerged as a reliable and low-cost option for putting commercial spacecraft and the satellites of other countries into space.</p>
<p>Experts say New Delhi can keep costs low by copying and adapting existing technology, and thanks to an abundance of highly skilled engineers who earn a fraction of their foreign counterparts&#8217; wages.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most populous country has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space programme growing considerably in size and momentum, matching the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag.</p>
<p>In August 2023, it became just the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the Moon after Russia, the United States and China.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced plans last year to send a man to the Moon by 2040. &#8211; AFP</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 5): Around 100 residents of Kampung Niantang, Pitas received their land ownership after more than two decades of waiting.</p>
<p>The village’s action body chairwoman, Hollynah Mopuas, 55, who was among those who received the ownership, expressed her gratitude to the State Government and the Land and Surveys Department (JTU) for approving 50.58 hectares of land for the residents after a 27-year wait.</p>
<p>However, she said the approved land is only part of the 169 hectares they are fighting for, which are lands that they have been residing on for decades, acknowledging that even though the State Government had offered them the remaining hectares at a nearby plot of land, they want another alternative.</p>
<p>She explained that some of the villagers were dissatisfied on the proposed resolution, due to disagreements in dividing the allotted replacement land.</p>
<p>“So we are hoping that the State Government can consider returning these remaining lands to the villagers, while the replacement land that they offered is given to the relevant company, as the lands given to the company is a rubber planting area while the replacement land is a forest area.</p>
<p>“We are also hoping that the State Government can revive a Sabah Rubber Industry Board (LIGS) project near the village, which has been delayed due to intrusion issues, to improve the surrounding economy and for the future generation,” she told a press conference at the Malaysia Humanitarian Organisation (MHO) Sabah office here on Thursday.</p>
<p>MHO Sabah coordinator Captain Jerry Jaimeh said the association has been providing assistance in resolving this problem after Hollynah raised the issue to the Chief Minister’s Department (CMD) two years ago.</p>
<p>Jerry said after villagers claimed that the grants for around half of 400 hectares of their customary land were released to a company, MHO and the villagers had a discussion with JTU and CMD, including State Local Government and Housing (KPKT) Minister Datuk Seri Joachim Gunsalam and JTU director Datuk Sr Bernard Liew Chau Min.</p>
<p>Following the discussions, he said CMD then issued a letter directing JTU officers to investigate the case and a meeting was held the same day, followed by land survey works which was carried out by the department within a four-month timeframe, and a State Government promise to provide another land to the villagers as replacement for the some 200 hectares.</p>
<p>Most recently, he said 43 land grant applications by the villagers have been approved, while 15 other grants are in the process, adding that he appreciates the relevant authorities’ swift actions to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Also present was Sabah Indigenous Peoples Organisation (POAS) president Alex Sanggun.</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 5): Efforts will be intensified next year for the Bukit Saban constituency to become a food-producing area, said Deputy Premier Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah Embas.</p>
<p>The Bukit Saban assemblyman said this would be facilitated by an allocation of RM60 million from the Betong Division Development Agency (BDDA).</p>
<p>“We have identified oil palm, pepper, padi, fruits and vegetable farming, in addition to poultry and pig-rearing and cottage industries like baking, Kebaya embroidery and others,” he said.</p>
<p>Uggah said this during a meeting with Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) Bukit Saban committee members at Rumah Mendit Unsu in Penom, Spaoh today.</p>
<p>He informed that the RM17 million Collection, Processing and Packaging Centre in Bebuling is nearing completion, and would assist producers in marketing their products.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of ordering the relevant facilities like machines for drying, packing and even deep freezing.</p>
<p>“With the Bebuling STOLport (short take-off and landing airport) expected to be ready in August next year, it will provide fast transportation of finished products outside,” he added.</p>
<p>He also said the Farmer&#8217;s Organisation and several other agencies would help in identifying the markets for the products.</p>
<p>On modern farming concepts like fertigation and hydroponics, Uggah said these would continue to be emphasised.</p>
<p>“We already have some locals who have successfully embraced both. We hope to train farmers in these modern concepts at the Bebuling Agropark.”</p>
<p>He said the agropark would consist of 65 hectares for a greenhouse and 300 hectares for other farming uses.</p>
<p>Uggah stressed it is critical that farmers became successful in all their endeavours in order to increase their income.</p>
<p>“Sarawak has already been recognised as a high-income region but there are still pockets of people who need help to raise their income level. The GPS (Gabungan Parti Sarawak) government is here to help them,” he said.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, the deputy premier visited the site of the Sungai Paku Bridge project to check on its construction progress.</p>
<p>The 107-metre-long bridge, costing RM36 million, is now 41 per cent completed and slightly ahead of its October 2025 scheduled completion date.</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 5): The Putrajaya has agreed to enhance the strength of the Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department (NCID), with priority given to Sarawak and Sabah.</p>
<p>According to NCID director Datuk Seri Khaw Kok Chin, the Public Service Department (JPA) has approved the phased reinforcement of the department.</p>
<p>“A total of 12 NCID positions have been added in 10 districts across Sarawak, with one position each for Matu Daro, Simunjan, Meradong, Saratok, Lubok Antu, Julau, Dalat, and Kanowit.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the districts of Song and Tatau have each been allocated two additional positions,” he told a press conference today after visiting the Sarawak General Operations Force (PGA) Brigade Headquarters here.</p>
<p>The purpose of the visit was to address border security issues in Sarawak and Sabah, focusing on collaboration between NCID and PGA in combating narcotics-related crimes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Khaw expressed appreciation to the Sarawak government, highlighting Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg’s contribution of four four-wheel-drive vehicles worth RM639,934.40 to the Sarawak Narcotics Nucleus Secretariat (SNN).</p>
<p>“This contribution enhances our efforts to curb drug-related activities along the Sarawak border,” he said.</p>
<p>In further strengthening operational capacity in line with technological advancements the Premier also provided a grant for the procurement of 19 Instant Visual Drug Detectors (IVDD) and two Handheld Backscatter devices valued at RM1,773,000.</p>
<p>“These tools significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of NCID Sarawak’s operations,” Khaw added.</p>
<p>The visit also saw Khaw present appreciation awards to officers who demonstrated exceptional dedication and commitment in combating narcotics in Sarawak and along its borders.</p>
<p>They included 28 senior police officers, 36 junior police officers, and four civilian officers from NCID Sarawak, PGA Sabah, PGA Sarawak, and Simunjan District Police Headquarters (IPD Simunjan).</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 5): BCS Aviation (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd and its director Dato Sri Robert Song Tung Wei have been charged in the Sessions Court with a total of 60 counts relating to refuelling operations conducted without a valid Ground Handling Licence (GHL).</p>
<p>The Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) in a statement today said BCS Aviation was charged with committing 30 offences under Section 37(1) of the Mavcom Act 2015, while Song was charged for the same 30 offences under Section 37(1) read together with Section 92(2)(b) of the same Act.</p>
<p>The offences were allegedly committed at the North Pan Hangar of Kuching International Airport between July 29 and Aug 18, 2019.</p>
<p>Conviction carries a fine not exceeding RM1 million or imprisonment for up to three years, or both.</p>
<p>A GHL issued by Mavcom is required by any person who wishes to carry out ground-handling services in Malaysia, which encompasses activities such as aircraft refuelling.</p>
<p>Both BCS Aviation and Song claimed trial to all charges before Sessions Court judges Iris Awen Jon, Afidah Abdul Rahman, Musli Ab Hamid and Saiful Bahari Adzmi.</p>
<p>Song was granted undeposited bail of RM30,000 with two local sureties, while BCS Aviation’s lawyer Datuk Akim Matrang was required to execute an undeposited bond of attendance of RM5,000 for each case.</p>
<p>Pre-trial case management was fixed for Jan 16, 2025.</p>
<p>Prosecuting is Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Azhari Yusof. Also appearing for BCS Aviation and Song were counsels Datuk Azrin Ahmat and Samuel Bong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mavcom chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim in the statement emphasised the importance of complying with industry laws and regulations, which are essential for operating in the aviation sector.</p>
<p>“All aviation players must secure all necessary regulatory approvals before commencing operations, as mandated by both Malaysian law and international standards.</p>
<p>“Mavcom remains committed to safeguarding the industry and will take firm action against any violations,” he said.</p>

<p>KUCHING (Dec 5): Hong Leong Group, alongside its business partner Pertama Ferroalloys, paid a courtesy call on Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg at the latter’s office in Wisma Bapa Malaysia last Monday.</p>
<p>This visit was led by Hong Leong Bank Manufacturing Group president Datuk Kwek Leng San and Pertama Ferroalloys general manager Yuki Nakamura.</p>
<p>According to a statement from Pertama Ferroalloys, the purpose of the visit was to engage in discussions on potential collaborations in line with Sarawak’s Post-Covid Development Strategy 2030 (PCDS 2030).</p>
<p>During the meeting, Abang Johari emphasised the critical role of high-quality cement in supporting infrastructure projects in Sarawak, highlighting the northern and eastern corridors of the region.</p>
<p>“The collaboration is between the state government, Hong Leong Group as producer and technology provider, and Pertama Ferroalloys as a competitive raw materials supplier for cement production.</p>
<p>“This would be significant in meeting the increasing demand for quality and competitive cement in Sarawak’s infrastructure projects,” he said.</p>
<p>He also underscored the alignment of this collaboration with PCDS 2030, noting its potential to enhance infrastructure connectivity while driving growth in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hong Leong Group expressed keen interest in exploring opportunities in township development and renewable energy projects in Sarawak.</p>
<p>The discussions also covered the broader economic and social impacts following this significant collaboration.</p>
<p>The partnership is expected to create job opportunities for local Sarawakians, stimulate local economies, and contribute to the overall welfare of the state’s communities – a shared vision crucial to promote sustainable growth in Sarawak.</p>
<p>Also present were Deputy State Secretary Dato Sri Abdullah Zaidel; Economic Planning Unit Sarawak director Datu Lester Mathew; Hong Leong Bank Group managing director and chief executive officer Kevin Lam; Hume Cement managing director William Tan Kok Siang; and Pertama Ferroalloys Public Affairs senior executive Augustine Lawang Mekai.</p>

<p>Dr Rundi emphasised that the initiative aims to contribute to the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) while ensuring food security.</p>
<p>“We rely heavily on imported food products, including 70 per cent of our rice, sourced from Vietnam and India.</p>
<p>“Should these countries face climate challenges, they may be unable to export to us. This underscores the need to modernise our agricultural industry for food security,” he said in his speech at the groundbreaking ceremony for the development of MFC Opar at Stungkor Baru here today.</p>
<p>Dr Rundi added that the MFC Opar project is extraordinary and new for Sarawak, particularly for the agricultural community.</p>
<p>He said that the project was initiated following two years of dialogue and brainstorming sessions, which were initiated after a study visit to the Netherlands in 2022 to learn about the MFC model in the country.</p>
<p>“After two years of dialogue, brainstorming sessions and so on, we have finally reached this stage &#8211; the groundbreaking ceremony for the MFC in Opar.</p>
<p>“We are excited to collaborate with our partners from the Netherlands, with the hope that one day, the status of our agricultural community will transform and be held in high regard, similar to those in developed nations like the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is my dream, and achieving this dream is a challenging task. The only way to empower the agricultural industry is by adopting new technologies,” he emphasised.</p>
<p>The MFC Opar, officiated by Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, is a pioneer project aimed at modernising Sarawak’s food industry.</p>
<p>The project is developed based on a public-private-community partnership involving Ministry of Food Industry, Commodity and Regional Development (M-FICORD), Sarawak Land Development Board (SLDB), the Sarawak Metropolitan Food Cluster Consortium (SMFC) Sdn Bhd, and local communities.</p>
<p>In addition to featuring Sarawak’s first semi-enclosed greenhouse integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), it will also utilise advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, climate-controlled boxes, and more.</p>
<p>The MFC Opar will empower local residents, particularly smallholders, through their participation in international collaborations to develop a sustainable and integrated circular economy in Sarawak.</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 5): The State Lands and Surveys Department is focused on creating more efficient systems to support property development in Sabah.</p>
<p>Its director, Datuk Bernard Liew Chau Min, said that the department has developed a few computerised and digital systems focused on helping and supporting property development in Sabah.</p>
<p>It also now has a system that handles online submissions.</p>
<p>Bernard explained that now, letters of offer for subdivisions and conversions are digitally generated and signed.</p>
<p>“So, if there is an offer of 100 lots, we can print (them) very easily, and we do not need to go to two of my officers to sign – one is to check, and the other is to sign, because it is now (done) digitally.</p>
<p>“They just press the button and it can be issued – as long as the landowner has paid the premium,” he added.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Shareda President and Council 2023–2025 Cocktail Evening at Baysuites on Wednesday,</p>
<p>Bernard also mentioned that the department has also conducted extensive digitalisation in its valuation section and it continues to carry out more systems to enhance its development section.</p>
<p>“The department wants to ensure efficiency and transparency in land administration, because efficient and transparent land administration will create trust among property developers, as well as investors,” he said.</p>
<p>The director also mentioned that the department has deployed its JTU web map application, an AI-assisted web map application, during the middle of this year.</p>
<p>“It functions like Google Maps,” he said.</p>
<p>Bernard explained that the department has also developed many standard operating procedures to ensure the land administration in Sabah is transparent and efficient.</p>
<p>“Before that, we had a piecemeal here and there. But what we do now is, we ensure that every system has an SOP. And every SOP, every process, there is a time frame,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, he said that the department has set a timeframe for Key Performance Index (KPI).</p>
<p>“There is a set timeframe for permission to transfer native title,” he said.</p>
<p>“The timeframe is set. We try to achieve but not necessarily we can achieve,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that they have achieved the timeframe set for permission to transfer for native titles, but it would take a longer time for permission to transfer leases as these require validation and because the volume is large.</p>
<p>Bernard also said Sabah&#8217;s property market has shown steady growth over the past three years, with transaction values through Memoranda of Transfers (MOT) reaching RM5.17 trillion as of 30 November 2024.</p>
<p>This represents a significant rise from RM3.57 trillion recorded in 2023.</p>
<p>Bernard highlighted the upward trajectory of Sabah&#8217;s property market, describing it as a testament to the fact that it is doing fine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shareda president Datuk Chua Soon Ping lauded the Sabah Government for actively listening to industry players and addressing the key issues that contribute to the growth and development of the real estate sector.</p>
<p>“The commitment to working collaboratively with us ensures a better future for both the industry and consumers, and we are grateful for your ongoing support and leadership,” said Chua.</p>
<p>He also commented on the implementation of the new policy on house ownership by Bumiputera buyers effective December 1 this year.</p>
<p>He added that the key changes in the policy are that developers must allocate 30 percent of houses to Bumiputera buyers, who can now choose their house lot.</p>
<p>“Developers will report sales every six months,” said Chua.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that the discounts for Bumiputera buyers, the five percent discount, remains, with any additional discounts to non-Bumiputera buyers added to this total (e.g. 15% discount to non-Bumiputera = 20% for Bumiputera buyers).</p>
<p>Chua also said that the resale restrictions have been abolished and Bumiputera buyers can re-sell their homes freely without approval.</p>
<p>“Pre-existing restrictions can be lifted upon application.</p>
<p>“Developers can release unsold non-Bumiputera lots to Bumiputera buyers if conditions are met, including full sale of non-Bumiputera lots and advertisement in newspapers,” he said.</p>
<p>On another issue, Chua said that the renewal of land leasehold tenure of 99 years for not less than 40 years due to expiry date, is now open for renewal of lease not limited to the years due.</p>
<p>He also said that the new guidelines of Sabah MM2H are underway and Shareda is hopeful and looking forward to it being released by the respective ministry and government soon.</p>

<p>TAWAU (Dec 5): A student testified at the High Court here Thursday that he overheard Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat Mohd Narul Azwan confessing that he had stolen money to one of the accused in dormitory room 7 Resak of the Lahad Datu Vocational College.</p>
<p>The 19th prosecution witness, Putra Azdaniel Jhalal Razhiel Jhalal, 19, a diploma student at the college, said he was not sure whose money the victim had stolen. He initially went to the dormitory to look for coloured pencils for a landscaping assignment at around 10 pm on March 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I entered (7 Resak), I saw Ijat (Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat) and the fifth accused discussing in the middle of the room. The fifth accused accused Ijat of stealing money. Then, Ijat went to his locker and brought out RM50, RM10, RM5, and three RM1 notes, handing them to the fifth accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ijat admitted he stole the money, saying ‘yes, I took it.’ Then, the first, fourth, and fifth accused started hitting the victim,&#8221; he said during his testimony at the murder trial of Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat before Judge Datuk Duncan Sikodol.</p>
<p>Thirteen students from the college, aged between 16 and 19, are jointly charged with the murder of 17-year-old Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat at dormitory rooms 7 Resak and 5 Belian of the Lahad Datu Vocational College, between 9 pm on March 21 and 7.38 am on March 22.</p>
<p>The charges are framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 of the same code, which provides for the death penalty or imprisonment for 30 to 40 years, and not more than 12 strokes of the cane, if found guilty.</p>
<p>During the examination-in-chief by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nur Nisla Abd Latif, Putra Azdaniel Jhalal said that at the time of the incident, the three accused were on his left and the victim on his right.</p>
<p>Putra Azdaniel Jhalal also said that the three accused had hit the victim more than once, but he could not confirm which parts of the victim&#8217;s body were struck.</p>
<p>He said that about an hour later, he went to room 5 Belian, still in search of the coloured pencils, and witnessed the 12th accused punching the victim&#8217;s body, while the second accused stomped on the victim&#8217;s head, who was lying on the floor at the time.</p>
<p>The witness also mentioned that he helped carry the victim to the Exco Belian bathroom to shower, and waited outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;After five minutes, I helped Ijat into room 7 Belian as I didn&#8217;t know which room he was from. I felt sorry for him; he had no energy and could barely walk. I then laid him on the bed,&#8221; he said, adding that the victim thanked him for the gesture.</p>
<p>Besides Nur Nisla, the prosecution is also being handled by deputy public prosecutors Ng Juhn Tao and Batrisyia Mohd Khusri.</p>
<p>Eight of the 13 teenagers are represented by lawyers Datuk Ram Singh, Kamarudin Mohmad Chinki, and Chen Wen Jye; while five others are represented by lawyers Mohamad Zairi Zainal Abidin, Abdul Ghani Zelika, Vivian Thien, Jhesseny P Kang, and Kusni Ambotuwo.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a Kolej Vokasional Lahad Datu student testified that the second accused had instructed everyone in dormitory room 5 Belian to leave him alone with Mohamad Nazmie on the night of the incident on March 21.</p>
<p>The 17th prosecution witness said that, upon receiving the instructions, several occupants of the room, including the 10 accused, namely the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and thirteenth accused, who had been involved in assaulting the victim, exited the room.</p>
<p>“The second accused told everyone to leave, saying, ‘Leave me with him (Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat)’. But I didn’t leave because I was tired, and a few other occupants stayed. I closed the door because I was scared and lay on the bed.</p>
<p>“At that time, the second accused and the victim were standing between a bed. I saw the accused punch the victim in the shoulder and kick him in the head and waist. Then, I saw the accused drag the victim’s hand to the middle of the room, but the victim struggled to get free.</p>
<p>“The accused then pushed the victim into the locker, causing a loud bang,” he said during the examination-in-chief by Nur Nisla.</p>
<p>The witness testified that after hearing a loud bang, the first, fifth, and sixth accused entered the room and told the second accused to stop. However, the second accused ordered them to leave, and the door was closed again.</p>
<p>He added that once the door was closed, the second accused continued to assault the victim, prompting Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat to plead for it to stop and call out to the first accused for help.</p>
<p>“The second accused then took the victim out of the room, but I didn’t know where he was taken,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 18th prosecution witness, who is also a student at the college, testified that he saw the victim was asleep on a mattress on the floor, covered in blankets, when he entered Dormitory Room 7 Belian at 5 am to take his toiletries.</p>
<p>“After taking a shower, I saw the 11th accused trying to wake the victim, but he didn’t respond. I thought he was asleep,” he said, adding that Dormitory Room 7 Belian was occupied by the first, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and 11th accused. &#8211; Bernama</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 5): Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and Universiti Malaya (UM) Thursday signed a letter of intent (LOI) to expand their collaboration in the study on poverty in Sabah and Labuan.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by the UMS Dean Faculty of Social Science and Humanities (FSSK) Prof Dr Asmady Idris and Ungku Aziz Centre for Development Studies (UAC) director Prof Dr Suhaiza Hanim Mohamad Zailani.</p>
<p>The LOI signing ceremony was witnessed by UMS vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Kasim Mansor and UAC UM adviser Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Kasim said the LOI not only benefits UMS and UM researchers but also expands the networking between institutions of higher education, development agencies and the private sector in Sabah as well as at the national level.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe and hope this collaboration will be more vibrant after the inking of the LOI between UAC UM and FSSK UMS. Close cooperation between agencies and strategic partners is not only needed but is also the foundation for success for the planned programmes, opening opportunities for more significant achievements and competitiveness,” he said.</p>
<p>He said this at the signing ceremony of the LOI and the Hardcore Poverty Eradication (BMT) Benchmark Programme carried out by UMS researchers for Sabah and Labuan here Thursday.</p>
<p>The BMT programme visit was attended by a delegation headed by UAC, UM as well as representatives from the Federal Territories Department, Agrobank Centre of Excellence (ACE) and Yayasan Sime Darby.</p>
<p>Kasim said such visits played a crucial role in creating a significant impact for both parties.<br />
&#8220;During this visit, the research head of the Hardcore Poverty Eradication Facilitation Grant (2022-2025), Assoc Prof Dr Jalihah Md Shah from FSSK and the entire UMS researchers involved in this grant will share their experience with fellow researchers from UAC UM regarding poverty findings in Sabah and Labuan,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the delegation&#8217;s presence reflected its objectives and commitment to tackling the issue of poverty in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot work in silo when it comes to research and we need strategic cooperation to unravel the problems of disparity and poverty that occur in society due to uncertainties at the global and national levels,” he said. &#8211; Bernama</p>

<p>KOTA KINABALU (Dec 5): Cosmetology students from Keningau Vocational College (KVC) clinched first and second places in the recycling competition of The KIDDOS Carnival, under the secondary school category, held in conjunction with the Taman Bandukan Music Festival.</p>
<p>The event, organized by Persatuan Boneo Bayu Kreatif Keningau, took place on November 29 at Ficus Hall, Taman Bandukan Riverside Resort.</p>
<p>The first place winner was awarded with a plaque, certificates and RM500 cash prize and the first runner-up was given RM300 along with a plaque and a certificate. The prizes were all sponsored by De Success Tupperware.</p>
<p>The team who won first place presented a stool designed for beauticians to perform pedicure outdoors. The stool was crafted from plastic bottles filled with old newspapers and plastic bags, which were tightly secured and reinforced with discarded materials such as wooden boards, wires and unused clothing.</p>
<p>The stool also featured a small compartment for storing cosmetic tools and products needed for pedicure.</p>
<p>This team comprised Jesslinda Had Kennedy, Chin Pui Yee and Venisia Maures. The second-place project was presented by Rosbianahlin Rosli, who created a pedicure brush made from corn cobs in which the packaging was made from corn husks.</p>
<p>The college director, Nordin bin Akup, expressed his joy at the students&#8217; achievements. He noted how their products align with the concepts of environmental sustainability and social entrepreneurship, which are increasingly emphasized in education as well as other sectors such as community development and economic revival.</p>
<p>He hopes that the students and teachers from the college will continue to develop products that benefit the community and preserve the environment.</p>

<p>LABUAN (Dec 5): The Labuan Public Works Department (JKR) has completed 15 road safety enhancement projects worth RM3.5 million in this duty-free island this year.</p>
<p>Its director Mohd Faizul Mohd Ali Hanapiah said that among the key projects were the upgrading of the Mohammed Salleh-Penghulu Tuah T-junction, the installation of traffic lights at the Kinabenuwa blackspot area, and the implementation of LED street lighting in Taman Orkid and other poorly illuminated areas across the island.</p>
<p>Additionally, traffic lights and pedestrian crossings were installed at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bebuloh and Sekolah Rendah Agama Patau-Patau to improve safety for both drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<p>Other improvements included painting major intersections and motorcycle waiting zones with a resin-based colour surfacing system to enhance traffic management.</p>
<p>“These initiatives reflect our holistic approach to managing road safety, which has already delivered positive results,” he said during the handover ceremony for the upgraded Mohammed Salleh-Penghulu Tuah T-junction here Thursday.</p>
<p>He added that as part of the Labuan Smart City Action Plan 2030, the department has prioritised sustainable and high-tech solutions.</p>
<p>“These efforts include installing energy-efficient solar-powered LED lights and implementing smart traffic signals to create safer, more sustainable environments,” he added.</p>
<p>Mohd Faizul highlighted a 70 per cent reduction in road fatalities in Labuan as of November 2024 compared to the previous year, based on statistics from the Labuan police, underscoring the effectiveness of the department’s safety measures.</p>
<p>He also emphasised the successful upgrade of the Mohammed Salleh-Penghulu Tuah T-junction, which had been a frequent accident hotspot. “This project not only enhances road safety but also improves the overall quality of life for our community by reducing accidents and fostering a safer environment,” he said.</p>
<p>He further outlined the department’s ongoing commitment to maintaining and upgrading the island’s road infrastructure, which encompasses 139.131 kilometres of federal roads; 11 bridges; 2,162 streetlights; 28 traffic light intersections; 39 intersections, and eight pedestrian traffic lights.</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, the department will continue to implement annual road safety programmes to ensure the comfort and safety of all road users on the island,” he concluded. – Bernama</p>

<p>KOTA SAMARAHAN (Dec 5): Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)’s 100th Convocation Ceremony (Session 4) at the UiTM Sarawak Campus Jubilee Hall today was a bittersweet occasion for Georgina John, 43.</p>
<p>Instead of celebrating alongside her late daughter Emiliany Lavinia Drunny, she attended the ceremony to accept the diploma in Electrical Engineering (Electronics) on behalf of Emiliany, who had worked so hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Emiliany, who passed away on January 30 this year due to complications from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), was remembered as a bright, kind-hearted, and independent young woman.</p>
<p>Born on September 11, 2002 in Kuching, Emiliany was the eldest of four siblings and the only daughter in her Bidayuh family from Kampung Paon Sungai Rimu, Serian.</p>
<p>“She had dreams of furthering her studies to a degree level&#8230; but that was her plan. She had a sudden diagnosis of lupus in January (2024). She was in and out of the hospital, and in just a week, we lost her,&#8221; Georgina told reporters after the convocation ceremony.</p>
<p>Despite her sorrow, Georgina spoke of Emiliany’s legacy with quiet pride, highlighting her academic excellence and the positive impact she had on others.</p>
<p>Emiliany had excelled not only in her studies at UiTM but also during her earlier schooling at SMK Kota Samarahan.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, she was a role model to her younger siblings, particularly her youngest brother, whom she often helped with mathematics, said Georgina.</p>
<p>“She was the only girl in our family and it&#8217;s a heavy loss for us. I have three other children &#8211; her brothers. The second one is already working, the third is in Form 5, and the youngest is just in primary 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in Taman Desa Ilmu now. My husband, who is from Kampung Petag, works in Kuching while I take care of the household,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As Georgina stood on stage to receive her late daughter’s diploma, the hall was filled with a solemn sense of respect and admiration.</p>
<p>“Maybe her youngest brother will follow in her footsteps as she used to guide him and encourage him. That’s something we will hold on to as we remember her,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The convocation ceremony concluded with UiTM officials extending their condolences to Georgina and her family, acknowledging the profound loss of a promising young graduate who had already touched so many lives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during the ceremony, UiTM Sarawak Pro-Chancellor Datuk Abdul Wahab Aziz stated that degrees and diplomas were awarded to 303 graduates during Session 4 of the convocation.</p>
<p>&#8220;These graduates hail from the College of Engineering, Faculty of Administrative Science and Policy Studies, Faculty of Hotel and Tourism Management, and the Academy of Contemporary Islamic Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, the graduation rate within the stipulated time frame for UiTM Sarawak Campus graduates recorded an impressive average of 85 per cent,&#8221; he said in his speech.</p>
<p>The UiTM 100th Convocation Ceremony at the UiTM Sarawak Campus was divided into four sessions over two days, celebrating the achievements of a total of 1,235 graduates.</p>

<p>A fire broke out on the top floor of several shophouses along Jalan Padungan here this afternoon.</p>
<p>According to the Sarawak Fire and Rescue Department (Bomba), they received a call at 4.55pm, prompting the dispatch of personnel and two fire engines from the Padungan and Tabuan Jaya fire stations.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, firefighters found that three units on the top floor of the shophouses were ablaze.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fborneopost.online%2Fvideos%2F1793216561433634%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=267&amp;t=0" width="267" height="476" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Bomba Sarawak assistant director (operations) Henderi Ardimansyah, when met at the scene, said the cause of the fire and the total losses incurred are still under investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our initial finding, we noticed marks to suggest that the fire had started from the upper floor of the grocery shop,&#8221; he said, adding that there were no reported injuries from the fire, and around 200 brand new motorcycles at a shop next door had been moved to safety.</p>
<p>Henderi explained that the fire had partially damaged three shop lots. The grocery shop in the middle sustained 60 per cent damage, the motorcycle shop suffered 50 per cent damage, and another shop was 30 per cent damaged.</p>
<div id="attachment_1225292" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1225292" class="size-full wp-image-1225292" src="https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2024/12/Kch-051224-ce-fire-p2.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="751" /><p id="caption-attachment-1225292" class="wp-caption-text">Henderi Ardimansyah</p></div>
<p>On that note, he advised shop owners in the area, particularly the older buildings like most in Padungan, which were built pre Independence Day 1957, to ensure that functioning fire extinguishing systems are installed in every unit.</p>
<p>These systems should be used immediately when signs of a fire are detected to prevent it from growing out of control, he added.</p>
<p>Henderi recalled a similar incident on March 8 this year at Carpenter Street, where a parked vehicle caught fire, which then spread to nearby shoplots, damaging four units.</p>
<p>Padungan assemblyman Chong Chieng Jen and Kuching South City Council Mayor Dato Wee Hong Seng were also seen at the scene.</p>
<p>Both apparently had rushed to the scene upon receiving news of the fire.</p>
