<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>In a significant development that could reshape Malaysia&#8217;s geopolitical standing, reports suggest the Southeast Asian nation may become a new base for Hamas leadership following their exodus from Qatar. </p>



<p>This move comes amid a broader regional redistribution of Hamas officials across several countries, including Turkey and Iran.</p>



<p>The prospect of Malaysia hosting Hamas members has drawn attention to the country&#8217;s long-standing position on the Palestinian cause and its historical connections to the organization. </p>



<p>Malaysia, which maintains no diplomatic relations with Israel, has previously been linked to Hamas activities, including <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/malaysia-iran-israel-triangle-amid-gaza-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">military training operations</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hamas to Malaysia makes sense given that their PM, Anwar Ibrahim, has good relations with Hamas and while Malaysia has historically been a key ally to Hamas. <br><br> A quick <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/990zLEgnIY">https://t.co/990zLEgnIY</a></p>&mdash; Abdelhalim Abdelrahman- عبد الحليم عبد الرحمن (@AbdelA1924) <a href="https://twitter.com/AbdelA1924/status/1863698868728201500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Past Ties Run Deep</h3>



<p>Malaysia&#8217;s complex relationship with Hamas included past incidents such as the 2018 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43854982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assassination of Hamas engineer Fadi Muhammad al-Batash</a> in the capital city. </p>



<p>Despite the incident, Malaysia&#8217;s strategic location and political stance make it an attractive option for relocating Hamas officials.</p>



<p>Malaysia&#8217;s position as a Muslim-majority nation with established infrastructure and relative stability also makes it a logical choice for Hamas leadership seeking new bases of operation.</p>



<p>This development could have significant implications for Malaysia&#8217;s international relations and domestic security considerations.</p>



<p>A key concern centers on <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/anwar-ibrahims-gaza-stance-tests-malaysia-united-states-relations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential U.S. reaction</a>, given Washington&#8217;s designation of Hamas as a terrorist organization. </p>



<p>Any move to host Hamas leadership could strain U.S.-Malaysia relations and potentially trigger diplomatic or economic repercussions, similar to sanctions imposed on other nations providing support to designated terrorist groups.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. When a Hamas leader, is killed, Anwar Ibrahim condemns Israel. The Trump 2.0 dream team are not going to take kindly to the pro-Hamas, pro-Iranian, &amp; pro-BRICS, stance of the M’sian PM.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hamas Relocation Plans Test Anwar&#8217;s Leadership Priorities</h3>



<p>The situation continues to evolve as Hamas officials, including former deputy to the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Khalil al-Hayya, <a href="https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/its-welcome-worn-out-qatar-hamas-seeks-new-home-base" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seek new bases</a> following their departure from Qatar. </p>



<p>While Turkish diplomatic sources have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-political-office-has-not-moved-turkey-qatar-turkish-source-says-2024-11-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged occasional visits by Hamas members</a>, Malaysia has yet to make an official statement regarding the potential relocation of Hamas leadership to its territory.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turkey, Russia, Iran Roll Out Red Carpet for Hamas.<br><br>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qatar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Qatar</a>’s expulsion of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hamas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Hamas</a> leaders, senior figures, including Khalil al-Hayya, have relocated to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Turkey?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Turkey</a>, with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Russia</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iran?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Iran</a> also offering refuge. Malaysia is reportedly considering hosting some leaders,… <a href="https://t.co/4bhcxby4bo">pic.twitter.com/4bhcxby4bo</a></p>&mdash; Amanda<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f397.png" alt="🎗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@MsAmandaJB) <a href="https://twitter.com/MsAmandaJB/status/1864355003118571910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>However, it is important to note that no official statement has been made by Malaysian authorities to either confirm or deny these claims, and the reports remain speculative at this stage.</p>



<p>The lack of official confirmation adds another layer of complexity to the situation, as both domestic critics and international observers await clarity on Malaysia&#8217;s position. </p>



<p>Wisma Putra, the nation&#8217;s Foreign Ministry, has maintained silence on the matter, leaving room for continued speculation about the country&#8217;s potential role in hosting Hamas leadership.</p>

<p>International Think Big Summit 2024: Crossroads: Where Diverging Minds Converge in Rojak Malaysia is a gathering of thought leaders and changemakers from diverse backgrounds, aiming to foster bold dialogues on polarizing issues and offer a platform for Malaysians to seek common ground in an increasingly divided and polarized society.</p>



<p>Some of the thought leaders joining the Summit include Shahril Hamdan, politician and co-host of Keluar Sekejap (KS) podcast, Syed Farid Al-Attas, prominent sociologist and professor of Sociology at National University of Singapore, YBrs.

<p>Lotus’s Malaysia have vouchers to give away and discounts up to 50% for customers to enjoy on a range of products starting today.</p>



<p>After 19 years in operations, serving communities residing within the state capital of Selangor and its neighbouring areas, Lotus’s Malaysia has given its Shah Alam outlet a total makeover beyond just a fresh coat of paint. </p>



<p>Great shopping deals are up for grabs with an opportunity to win prizes worth more than RM24,000 through the many available activities lined up. </p>



<p>The 9,000 square meter hypermarket and mall located along Jalan Aerobik, Seksyen 13, Shah Alam went through a massive remodelling exercise to cater to not only the shopping needs of end consumers but also business operators, food retailers, food services, HoReCA and philanthropic organisations.</p>



<p>Mirroring the retailer’s hybrid store in Puchong, Lotus’s Shah Alam is a slighter version of this new format; filled with over 13,000 product lines with more than 280 of them being HoReCa ranges that include cooking needs, fresh produce, household cleaning products, and canned food. </p>

<p>These days, lots of peeps (especially the youngins) are all about wearing or owning branded luxury items.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s be real—not everyone can afford those pricey things, so some even rent them to keep up with the trends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Woman goes viral for renting an iPhone 16 for three days</h2>



<p>Recently, a woman who sought to rent an Apple iPhone 16 for three days went viral on social media.</p>



<p>Through a post uploaded by the woman on social media platform Threads, she said she did not care what colour the iPhone 16 for rent was.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone, please help me find someone who can rent an iPhone 16, the colour doesn&#8217;t matter. I want to rent it for three days,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Renting the iPhone to &#8220;flex&#8221;</h2>



<p>What caught the attention of many her reason to rent an iPhone 16, which was simply to &#8220;flex&#8221; that she owns the expensive device.</p>



<p>&#8220;The reason is just to flex. Please repost so I can rent an iPhone 16,&#8221; she added.</p>



<p>Her actions and the reason she gave for it brought a lot of criticism from others. She also claimed that she only intended to rent an iPhone 16 and not buy it as she already owns an iPhone 15 Pro.</p>



<p>She then said she will purchase an iPhone 16 after receiving a lot of flak on Threads.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>As Malaysia moves toward sustainability and smart urban mobility, owning an electric motorcycle is becoming an increasingly popular choice.</p>



<p>The combination of cost savings, convenience, and eco-friendliness makes electric motorcycles an attractive alternative to traditional petrol-powered bikes.</p>



<p>On top of that, Malaysians who earn RM120,000 or less annually are entitled to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nst.com.my/business/corporate/2023/12/987920/applications-electric-motorcyles-rebates-rm2400-opens-today">rebates of up to RM2,400</a>&nbsp;for purchase of locally assembled electric motorcycles under the Electric Motorcycle Use Promotion Scheme dubbed <a href="https://insentif.marii.my/mariicas">MARiiCas</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why are electric motorcycles better than conventional ones?</h2>



<p>For those who are unfamiliar with electric motorcycles, you will be pleasantly surprised how well they perform and also how reliable they can be.</p>



<p>Here are a few factors that give them the upper hand against traditional, petrol bikes:</p>



<p><strong>Instant torque and power</strong></p>



<p>While gas-powered engines take longer to power up and reach peak torque, requiring the engine to be spinning at high rpm (revolutions per minute), electric motors can output their peak power and torque instantly from 0 rpm and maintain consistent power and torque through the entire rpm range too.</p>



<p>This simply means that electric motorcycles have better acceleration, which is useful when overtaking vehicles or climbing a hill, especially in heavy traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Provides more comfort</strong></p>



<p>Compared to conventional ones, electric motorcycles don&#8217;t vibrate or shake while riding or when stopped at a traffic light.</p>



<p>While there are many petrol engines that provide additional counter-balances that reduce vibrations, it also adds more complexities to the bike without totally eliminating vibration.</p>



<p>Additionally, you also don&#8217;t have to worry about burning yourself on the hot exhaust header.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="950" height="534" src="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-932121" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22.png 950w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-300x169.png 300w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-768x432.png 768w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-370x208.png 370w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-800x450.png 800w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-20x11.png 20w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-740x416.png 740w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22-85x48.png 85w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tuning and updates</strong></p>



<p>One of the best parts about owning an electric motorcycle is it&#8217;s easier to customize the bike&#8217;s performance to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Some e-bikes have a built-in performance profile customizer where you can adjust the power and behaviour of the motor.</p>



<p>Compared to petrol-powered motorcycles, there are no carburetors to mess with, and no engine timing or injector profiles to adjust.</p>



<p>Most electric motorcycles also receive regular over-the-air (OTA) updates bringing new features, improved rideability, safety, and other goodies, similar to how you’d update your smartphone. That way, your bike can stay relevant for longer and continuously improve itself.</p>



<p><strong>Convenient to run and maintain</strong></p>



<p>With an electric motorcycle, you don’t have to worry about running out of fuel. You can easily use your own charging station in your house or garage to charge your bike’s batteries.</p>



<p>Also, since electric motorcycle batteries are much smaller than those in electric cars, they take a shorter time to charge, often three to five hours depending on the battery capacity.</p>

<p>Some electric motorcycles in Malaysia have compact, removable batteries that you can swap with a fresh battery at a battery swapping station.</p>



<p>Maintaining an electric motorcycle is generally easier and cheaper than a conventional one since there are fewer parts to maintain, and that can offset the higher price of electric motorcycles in Malaysia.</p>



<p>If you’re considering making the switch, here are some great options for electric motorcycles available on the market.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most premium in this electric motorcycle lineup, the <a href="https://www.bmw-motorrad.com.my/en/models/urban_mobility/ce04.html">BMW CE 04</a> is well equipped in the tech department.</p>



<p>Sporting a 10.25-inch color display that can be connected to the BMW Motorrad Connected app, providing features like GPS with turn-by-turn navigation, as well as vehicle status.</p>



<p>It charges fairly quickly &#8211; in just four hours and 20 minutes &#8211; with a regular 2.3kW charger.</p>



<p>The CE 04 can reach speeds of 120kmh, and has a maximum range of 130km. The bike does not come cheap – as expected of a BMW – at RM59,900.</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for a commuter or an off-road e-motorcycle, these are some of the best choices available on the market right now.</p>



<p>Although they&#8217;re not really priced for tight budgets, they&#8217;re actually much more affordable in the long run, seeing as how maintenance costs are lower compared to traditional petrol motorcycles.</p>



<p>What do you think about the electric motorcycles available in Malaysia right now? </p>



<p>Do you think it’s a good time to invest in one, or do you think that the current price and performance are still not as competitive as regular motorcycles?</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Gamuda Land recently held a groundbreaking ceremony for two public primary schools, marking a significant step in the township’s commitment to holistic community development.</p>



<p>The event was officiated by Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek underscoring the government’s dedication to enhancing accessibility to education in Malaysia’s growing urban and suburban areas.</p>



<p>Set within the 1,530-acre nature sanctuary and smart city township of Gamuda Cove, these schools will be developed in two phases and will cater to 2,400 students across 48 classrooms once completed.</p>



<p>The first phase for both schools is targeted to be completed by 2026.</p>



<p>The groundbreaking for the primary schools at Gamuda Cove highlights the government&#8217;s commitment to strengthening educational infrastructure nationwide. By establishing these schools in rapidly growing townships, the government is laying a solid academic foundation for young Malaysians and ensuring that families have improved access to essential facilities.</p>



<p>This initiative emphasises the importance of educational facilities in urban development, with the government continuing to collaborate with key stakeholders, such as township developers, to ensure that school planning in new townships is implemented correctly from the outset.</p>



<p>This effort aims to enhance access to quality education while meeting the needs of growing communities.</p>



<p>Gamuda Berhad Chairman Tan Sri Datuk Setia Ambrin Buang said that Gamuda Cove was masterplanned to create an urban sanctuary and smart city where people can grow up and grow old.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>By ensuring that education is integrated into our developments, alongside public parks, commercial centres, and green spaces, we aim to provide families with a home place where they can thrive. These schools are a testament to our commitment to building vibrant, self-sustaining communities where residents can enjoy a high quality of life.</p>
<cite>Gamuda Berhad Chairman Tan Sri Datuk Setia Ambrin Buang.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The 90-acre Wetlands Arboretum, one of Gamuda Cove’s iconic features, further reflects this commitment to sustainability and education.</p>



<p>Designed as a hub for environmental education, the arboretum offers students and the wider community an out-of-classroom opportunity to learn about biodiversity, conservation, and sustainable living in an immersive natural setting.</p>



<p>This unique aspect enriches the township’s educational offerings, going beyond traditional classrooms to nurture environmentally conscious and well-rounded individuals.</p>



<p>In addition to these primary schools, Gamuda Cove already hosts the Big Apple Preschool at The Hive, catering to early childhood education, and will welcome an affordable international school by Taylor’s Education Group by 2027.</p>



<p>These educational institutions address a growing demand for schooling options in the region.</p>



<p>With the nearest public school located 20 minutes away, the new schools will serve not only Gamuda Cove residents but also families from neighbouring areas such as Bandar Saujana Putra and Bandar Rimbayu.</p>



<p>By the time these schools are completed in 2026, Gamuda Cove will have handed over more than 3,200 residential units, bringing an estimated population of over 13,000 to the township.</p>



<p>The development also features four vibrant commercial hubs—Townsquare, Bay Square, Bay Street, and The Hive—offering over 180 retail spaces for lifestyle, F&amp;B, and daily conveniences.</p>



<p>Complementing these amenities, Gamuda Cove’s commitment to sustainability is reflected in its 75 km of cycling and walking paths, safe pedestrian access to key hubs, and eco-friendly transport options like the operational e-tram service.</p>



<p>Residents will also benefit from enhanced connectivity through the upcoming 2-km toll-free Cyberjaya-Link, opening in 2025, which will halve travel time to Cyberjaya and nearby areas.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Kebaya has been officially added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity category by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (Unesco).</p>



<p>The initiative to nominate “Kebaya: Knowledge, Skills, Traditions and Practices” under Unesco was a joint nomination led by Malaysia’s Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture (Motac) with Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, and Thailand in 2023.</p>

<p>The outcome was announced at 9.50pm Malaysia time on 4 December 2024 during the 19<sup>th</sup> session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (IGC ICH) in Asuncion, Paraguay.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMyMOTAC%2Fposts%2Fpfbid022z9APhD948Yw2d2fNuv7yP7QoPnBsDB2ccPFDuz5SPy7nkn9wYCxnhz266cDQSC4l&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500" width="500" height="785" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The prestigious listing was decided by the IGC ICH, which comprises 24 member states of the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. This recognition is even more meaningful given that the evaluation body of Unesco has recognised the kebaya nomination dossier as an exemplary and prestigious submission for a joint or multinational nomination.</p>
<cite>Malaysia’s Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture (Motac)</cite></blockquote>



<p>According to Motac, it’s Malaysia’s third successful joint or multinational nomination, after the joint nomination of Pantun with Indonesia (2020) and the Wangkang Ceremony with China (2020).</p>



<p>This recognition enhanced Malaysia’s global visibility as a country with intangible cultural heritage treasures which had the potential to enhance tourism and contribute economically.</p>



<p>Motac attributed the success of promoting kebaya as a symbol of regional heritage a result of strategic and collective cooperation with Asean member countries such as Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, the Department of National Heritage, the Malaysian National Commission for Unesco, the Office of the Permanent Delegate of Malaysia to Unesco, and the Foreign Ministry.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a kebaya?</h3>



<p>The kebaya is a long-sleeved upper garment that is easily recognisable by its intricate embroidery which became fashionable in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>



<p>The kebaya is also worn by flight attendants of national carriers such as Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia.</p>



<p>Many women like wearing the kebaya due to its timelessness and classiness. This also makes the kebaya a suitable garment for both casual and formal events.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Malaysia&#8217;s breakfast culture made the list too</h3>



<p>In another update, Motac said Malaysia is successful in adding &#8220;Breakfast Culture in Malaysia: Dining Experience in a Multi-Ethnic Society&#8221; to Unesco&#8217;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity category.</p>



<p>It was Malaysia&#8217;s first nomination relating to food and gastronomy. The recognition showed that Malaysia&#8217;s breakfast food has distinct elements that show different cultures and identities in the country.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Twitter user DragonForce Malaysia (@dragonforceIO_) revealed that the alleged leaked MyKad data could be fake.</p>



<p>After somehow unscrambling the pixelated images, the names on the MyKad read Devil bin Satan, Mohd Daniyal Hanger, and Dato Husin. The pictures were clearly mismatched to the names too, further indicating signs of fraud.</p>



<p>Even the poor dude Chua Lai Fatt’s alleged MyKad made an appearance. If you don’t remember, Chua is a <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2016/02/20/united-in-anger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real person</a> who became famous during the 13<sup>th</sup> general election. He is an Indian Malaysian who was adopted by a Chinese Malaysian family.</p>



<p>However, there’s no guarantee that the “unveiling” is real either seeing that the fonts look strange and wonky.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;17 million Malaysian ICs have been leaked on the darkweb.&quot;<br><br>The ICs: <a href="https://t.co/H7whJYEPhW">https://t.co/H7whJYEPhW</a> <a href="https://t.co/CthL1QH7Un">pic.twitter.com/CthL1QH7Un</a></p>&mdash; The Futurizts (@TheFuturizts) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFuturizts/status/1864243477124665525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Home Ministry: No MyKad data leakage</h3>



<p>Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Ministry <a href="https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/736537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> there was a MyKad data leak as claimed yesterday.</p>



<p>Its minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said there are no incidents of 17 million identity card data leakage after thorough checks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>So far, no incident of leakage has been reported. The government guarantees that the integrity of data, especially the people’s information, is always maintained.</p>
<cite>Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail</cite></blockquote>



<p>He had asked the National Registration Department (JPN) and the Information Technology Security division to investigate the matter.</p>



<p><strong>So, where does that leave us?</strong> It’s best to wait for the National Cyber Security Agency (Nacsa) to complete its investigation and always monitor your bank accounts, leak or no leak.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>If you’ve ever driven in Kuala Lumpur, you’ll understand the frustration of navigating through the city’s traffic. It’s not just the congestion—it’s the inefficiency that drives you up the wall, quite literally.</p>



<p>As someone from Penang, an island girl who’s used to shorter commutes and a slightly less chaotic flow of traffic, KL roads baffle me. Every drive feels like stepping into a circus, and not in a good way.</p>



<p>Take the RFID lanes at tolls, for example. Touch ‘n Go (TNG), with its near-monopoly on cashless toll payments, has been heavily promoting RFID for years now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, why is there often only&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;RFID lane at toll plazas? Everyone ends up funneling into this single lane, causing massive bottlenecks. Isn’t RFID supposed to make traffic flow&nbsp;<em>smoother</em>?</p>



<p>Instead, it’s chaos. Non-RFID users accidentally queue up, confused drivers reverse out, and you sit there questioning your life choices as the clock ticks away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worse still, the RFID lanes aren’t even standardised. Some are on the far right, others are in the middle, and some are tucked somewhere in between, leaving drivers guessing and scrambling to merge at the last second.</p>



<p>And then there’s the technology itself, which often feels like more hassle than it’s worth. Improper installations—whether on headlights or windscreens—lead to inconsistent readings, and even when installed correctly, the scanners occasionally fail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drivers who follow the rules are still punished, stuck behind someone whose RFID isn’t detected, causing a ripple effect of delays as cars reverse or switch lanes in a panic.</p>



<p>It’s ironic, really. RFID is marketed as a ‘fit and forget’ system, but in practice, it creates more headaches than solutions. Pair that with the lack of investment in better infrastructure, and it’s clear that drivers are paying tolls not for convenience but for frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KL traffic already tests your patience, but these poorly planned systems make it feel like we’re stuck in first gear—literally and figuratively.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Malaysia’s borders are a chaotic legacy of British colonial tinkering, strategic geopolitics, and a federation cobbled together with compromises. When the British drew their plans for Malaysia, it wasn’t with unity in mind but convenience—and maybe a touch of ‘divide and rule’ genius.</p>



<p>The Federation of Malaysia, formed in 1963, united Peninsular Malaysia with Singapore, Sabah, and Sarawak. At first glance, it seemed like a bold move to stabilise the region. But look closer, and you’ll find a patchwork of political autonomy, cultural divides, and a sprinkling of “oops moments.” </p>



<p>Sabah and Sarawak got significant autonomy—think immigration control and land rights—while Peninsular Malaysia remained the political and economic centre. </p>



<p>Singapore, however, wasn’t sticking around long enough to enjoy the chaos; it was politely shown the door in 1965 due to political and ethnic tensions.</p>



<p><strong>One Peninsula, Two Stories</strong></p>



<p>Even within the peninsula, the story of uneven development is as fascinating as it is frustrating. The British favoured the Indian Ocean side, where major ports and trade hubs like Penang and Malacca thrived. </p>



<p>The South China Sea coast was largely ignored, separated by rugged mountain ranges, making it feel like a different world altogether. This neglect left places like Kelantan charmingly laid-back but historically underdeveloped.</p>



<p><strong>Sabah and Sarawak: More Autonomy, Less Equality</strong></p>



<p>The autonomy granted to Sabah and Sarawak was meant to sweeten the deal for joining Malaysia, allowing them to preserve their unique identities. But decades later, the imbalance between East and West Malaysia is stark. Sabah and Sarawak often feel like distant relatives who aren’t invited to the big family decisions. </p>



<p>It’s a case of one-sided autonomy—a bittersweet setup where they can manage local matters but remain politically marginalised. The absentee landlord problem? Alive and well, with power concentrated firmly in the peninsula.</p>



<p><strong>KL, Georgetown, and Malacca: A Tale of Three Cities</strong></p>



<p>If Malaysia’s cities were siblings, Kuala Lumpur would be the ambitious middle child—less uptight than Singapore but just as determined. Georgetown feels like a nostalgic uncle, steeped in colonial charm and old-world character. Malacca? A quirky cousin with European vibes. Together, they tell a story of Malaysia’s colonial past, with each city bearing the hallmarks of its unique historical influences.</p>



<p><strong>Historical Hiccups and Humour</strong></p>



<p>And then there are the oddities, like the Japanese invasion of Kelantan in 1941—a full two hours before Pearl Harbour. No one in the United States knew about it because communications were so bad in the remote, jungle-covered region. It’s just another example of how Malaysia’s geography has influenced its history in unexpected ways.</p>



<p><strong>The Lasting Legacy</strong></p>



<p>Today, Malaysia’s map is a visual reminder of colonial ambition and cultural diversity. It’s a nation shaped by compromises, where autonomy and inequality coexist. The borders may not be perfect, but they tell a story that’s uniquely Malaysian—messy, diverse, and endlessly fascinating.</p>

<p>Logging onto the internet in Malaysia is like walking into a mamak stall at midnight – chaotic, loud, and somehow making perfect sense to those who know the unwritten rules.</p>



<p>The internet here is a social minefield where every meme, comment, and share is a strategic move. One wrong word, and you’re either cancelled or become the day’s top viral content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaysians have mastered the skill of saying everything by saying almost nothing – a linguistic tightrope walk that would make diplomats proud.</p>



<p>Manglish becomes your shield and sword. “Just joking lah” isn’t just a phrase – it’s a get-out-of-trouble-free card. A carefully constructed sentence that can be interpreted thirteen different ways if someone decides to take offense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where else can “alamak” convey more emotions than an entire paragraph? A single “lah” can transform a statement from aggressive to endearing, from serious to playful. It’s linguistic magic that no translation app could ever capture.</p>



<p>Gen Z users have turned this into a survival strategy. They craft posts like intricate puzzles – provocative enough to be interesting, vague enough to be defensible. Screenshots get saved, context gets twisted, and everyone knows the unwritten rules of digital engagement.</p>



<p>Sometimes, an Instagram story isn’t just content – it’s a carefully crafted commentary that can roast a politician, support a cause, and make you laugh, all in 15 seconds.</p>



<p>Meme culture becomes a form of subtle rebellion. Political commentary, social critique, and pure comedic genius blend so seamlessly that sometimes you can’t tell if you’re laughing or being educated. A viral meme can spark more meaningful conversations than most parliamentary debates. Because direct criticism is risky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WhatsApp groups are where the real conversations happen. Private, encrypted, away from public scrutiny. Here, opinions flow freely, but always with an understanding – screenshot at your own risk.</p>



<p>In this digital space, you’re never just one identity. You’re Malay, Chinese, Indian, or dan lain-lain. You’re a professional, a joker, a critic, and a friend – sometimes all in the same message.</p>



<p>The delete button is every Malaysian netizen’s best friend. It’s not about erasing content; it’s about strategic communication. Type, pause, reconsider, and&nbsp;<em>potentially</em>&nbsp;delete.</p>



<p>In the end, Malaysian digital communication is a constant negotiation. Speak, delete, repeat – rinse and wash, until you’ve said just enough without saying too much.</p>

<p>While Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services offer undeniable convenience, they represent a financial double-edged sword that demands careful navigation. Your personal experience – benefiting from the service while simultaneously maintaining reservations – reflects a common consumer sentiment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-psychological-trap-of-instant-gratification">The Psychological Trap of Instant Gratification</h2>



<p>BNPL platforms exploit a fundamental human weakness: the desire for immediate satisfaction with deferred consequences. They transform purchasing from a deliberative process to an impulsive action, making it easier to spend money you don’t immediately have.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-real-cost-beyond-numbers">The Real Cost Beyond Numbers</h3>



<p>Despite appearing interest-free, BNPL services carry hidden costs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Potential late payment fees</li>



<li>Soft credit checks impacting credit scores</li>



<li>Normalisation of debt as a lifestyle</li>



<li>Psychological burden of outstanding payments</li>
</ul>



<p>In Malaysia, BNPL has grown exponentially, driven by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High smartphone penetration</li>



<li>Young, digitally-savvy population</li>



<li>E-commerce platform integration</li>



<li>Pandemic-accelerated digital financial adoption</li>
</ul>



<p>Bank Negara Malaysia is increasingly scrutinising these platforms, recognising both their innovation potential and consumer protection concerns. The regulatory approach suggests a balanced view: neither outright prohibition nor complete laissez-faire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-you-are-using-bnpl-consider-these-guidelines"><em>If you are using BNPL</em>, consider these guidelines:</h4>



<p><strong>Treat as Cash, Not Credit</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Only purchase what you can afford upfront</li>



<li>Use as a payment mechanism, not a lending tool</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Strict Personal Tracking</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Maintain a separate spreadsheet of BNPL commitments</li>



<li>Set calendar reminders for repayments</li>



<li>Never miss a payment</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Platform Diversification</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Understand each platform’s unique terms</li>



<li>Avoid dependency on a single BNPL service</li>
</ul>



<p>Instead of viewing BNPL as a financial lifeline, consider it a temporary convenience tool with potential pitfalls. Your skepticism is not just valid – it’s financially prudent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-broader-economic-implication">The Broader Economic Implication</h3>



<p>As digital finance continues to evolve, BNPL services represent more than a mere payment method. They are a complex symptom of broader economic transformations, signaling profound shifts in how younger generations perceive financial interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This emerging ecosystem reflects declining traditional banking relevance, the accelerating pace of financial digitalisation, and fundamentally changing consumer credit expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What emerges is not just a new payment tool, but a nuanced reflection of societal attitudes towards money, consumption, and instant gratification in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>There were claims on social media that data from the MyKads of 17 million Malaysians had been leaked and up for sale on the dark web.</p>



<p>As proof, pictures showing samples of Malaysian Identification Cards (ICs) were shared on the dark web.</p>



<p>Based on the images, some netizens said it looked like the ICs were from e-KYC verifications and wondered where the source of the leak was.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nacsa is investigating MyKad leak claims</h3>



<p>Due to the potential massive data breach, the National Cyber Security Agency (Nacsa) has launched an investigation into the claims.</p>



<p>According to current reports, Nacsa’s experts are working to verify the claims and assess the extent of the possible data leak.</p>



<p>For the time being, the public is advised to monitor their bank accounts and credit reports for suspicious transactions.</p>



<p>They’re also reminded to be wary about receiving calls or messages from unknown numbers, especially messages containing any links or attachments. <em>If it needs to be said again, please don’t click on the link or open any attachments from people you don’t know.</em></p>



<p>In April 2023, the government instructed Malaysian telecommunication companies to block any URL links in short message service(SMS) to prevent further fraud cases.</p>



<p>However, these scams persist today with some unwitting victims falling prey and losing hard-earned money.</p>

<p>The Digital Ministry, through the Personal Data Protection Commissioner’s Office, had received complaints and reports of personal data leaks from other agencies, including the Royal Malaysia Police, Bank Negara Malaysia, and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).</p>



<p>This is not the first or last time Malaysians have gone through data leaks. In 2023, a hacker group attacked the Social Security Organisation (Perkeso) and leaked personal information such as MyKad numbers, salaries, addresses and phone numbers.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>We are thrilled to unveil delightful limited-edition creation, born from the perfect blend of Glenmorangie’s innovative spirit and <em>The Ice Cream Bar</em>’s artisanal expertise. The exquisite <em>Popcorn Old Fashioned</em> ice cream is our toast to the festive season, which not only celebrates the essence of whisky but also presents it in an exciting and refreshing new way, making it a perfect addition to any festive gathering or celebration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For more than 180 years, Glenmorangie’s whisky creators have been endlessly imaginative in their quest to create evermore delicious single malts.</p>



<p>Led by Director of Whisky Creation Bill Lumsden, they are constantly challenging themselves to take whatever captures their imaginations and turn it into whisky. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ice cream is an irresistible indulgence, and inspired by the flavours you might find on an ice cream parlour menu, we imagined creating a whisky of melting decadence and lavish swirls of flavour. By ageing Glenmorangie in bourbon and high-vanillin casks, we have deliciously magnified our whisky’s sweetest, creamiest side. With notes of peach melba, lemon sorbet, coconut flakes and rich vanilla, sipping Glenmorangie A Tale of Ice Cream is like sinking your spoon into a carousel of flavour. We invite whisky lovers old and new to indulge their sweet tooth and enjoy this ultimate treat!</p>

<p>Haier announced its strategy, business direction and targets for 2025 as well as reviewed progress made in 2024 in Malaysia towards its ambition of being the leading appliance brand in the nation. </p>



<p>This was made during the brand’s Southeast Asia Dealer Conference, held in Malaysia for the first time, signifying the country’s importance to Haier.</p>



<p>The event brought together 600 delegates from eight countries, who were feted to local cuisine, cultural performances, and a sightseeing tour, contributing to Malaysia’s tourism and hospitality sector. </p>



<p>In reviewing its performance, Haier Malaysia announced that it achieved its projected 40% overall growth for 2024 ahead of the holiday period.</p>



<p>All the Haier product categories experienced robust growth, with air conditioner sales rising a spectacular 47% year-on-year  (YOY) followed by televisions (38%), washing machines (37%) and refrigerators (35%). </p>



<p>The brand has been actively engaging with dealers locally and also customers, obtaining feedback and providing home appliances that align with modern preferences as well as initiatives to reduce energy consumption. </p>



<p>Building on this momentum, Haier has lined up several new models for Malaysia in 2025, headlined by room air conditioners.</p>



<p>In addition, Haier has also set sights on extending its market position across multiple categories by introducing a wider range of models and variants to fit diverse customer needs. </p>



<p>Haier is now the No.1 room air conditioner brand in Malaysia (GfK report, June 2024) and aims to become the absolute market leader for home appliances in the country. </p>



<p>Haier Malaysia Managing Director Fan Jing said that the brand&#8217;s strong performance in 2024 reaffirms Malaysia’s position as a core market for Haier, both regionally and globally.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The 2024 performance lays a strong foundation for us and we aim to sustain a high revenue growth of 30% consistently over the next five years. We also aspire to improve our market leadership in the country with a market share exceeding 30% by 2029.</p>
<cite>Haier Malaysia Managing Director Fan Jing.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fan Jing added that the decision to host the Southeast Asia Dealer Conference in Malaysia underscores the country’s growing importance within the Haier network.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This milestone coincides with Haier’s 40th anniversary, making it a double celebration. It is an opportunity to showcase Malaysia’s unique charm to our regional partners while highlighting how our products seamlessly integrate into daily life, elevating comfort and convenience for customers. Malaysians’  savviness resonates with our desire to promote &#8216;More Creation, More Possibilities&#8217; as we shape a world with infinite wonderful possibilities. We continuously listen to customers’ feedback, channelling the insights into research and development to produce top-notch products that align with modern needs and preferences.</p>
<cite>Haier Malaysia Managing Director Fan Jing.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Haier Malaysia also stated that it will be focussing on three core strategies in 2025.</p>



<p>The brand has identified strengthening high-end product offerings, differentiated marketing initiatives and deepening the use of digitalisation to power its growth in the coming year. </p>



<p>Haier is also planning to increase its brand shops to 75, up from the current 55.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the event, Haier gave a glimpse of the new products that await Malaysians by previewing a comprehensive suite of home appliances to elevate domestic living.</p>



<p>These included refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, room air conditioners, commercial air conditioners, televisions, kitchen appliances and water heaters with the latest technology. </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Malaysian singer Jaclyn Victor recently went on You Syu’d Know, a podcast hosted by TV presenter and newsreader Syuhaida Ariffin, to share something shocking she was told after she won the Malaysian Idol in 2004.</p>



<p>In the short TikTok clip promoting the show’s 25<sup>th</sup> episode, Victor told Syuhaida that she heard from the grapevine that someone said she shouldn’t have won the singing competition because she wasn’t a Malay person.</p>



<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@yousyudknow/video/7444157991198199047" data-video-id="7444157991198199047" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@yousyudknow" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yousyudknow?refer=embed" rel="noopener">@yousyudknow</a> Ada orang pernah kata yang @Jaclyn Victor TAK patut menang Malaysian Idol kerana dia bukan orang Melayu. Hhmmmm..  Jangan macam tu. Kite kan orang Malaysia. Lahir di Malaysia, IC pun Malaysia.  Kite patut berbangga dengan Talent yang ada pada Jac ni.  Apa-apa pun Jac tetap work hard seperti rakyat Malaysia yang lain.  Episode penuh ada kat link. Jom layannnn..  <a title="podcast" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/podcast?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#podcast</a> <a title="yousyudknow" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/yousyudknow?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#yousyudknow</a> <a title="malaysianpodcast" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/malaysianpodcast?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#malaysianpodcast</a> <a title="malaysianidol" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/malaysianidol?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#malaysianidol</a> <a title="idol" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/idol?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#idol</a> <a title="melayu" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/melayu?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#melayu</a> <a title="bukanmelayu" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bukanmelayu?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#bukanmelayu</a> <a title="malaysian" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/malaysian?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#malaysian</a> <a title="rakyatmalaysia" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/rakyatmalaysia?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#rakyatmalaysia</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound  - You Syu’D Know" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-You-Syu’D-Know-7444158036698090241?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound  &#8211; You Syu’D Know</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>Victor admitted that it was a shocking statement to her at the time and jokingly asked if she was supposed to compete in Indian Idol, eliciting laughs from Syuhaida.</p>



<p>Victor said she’s a Malaysian who was born and raised in Malaysia. She also speaks (and sings) in Bahasa Melayu, the national language.</p>



<p>Since years have passed, Victor said what the person said doesn’t matter and the person&#8217;s opinions didn’t define her life and what she does.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>There’ll be all kinds of things said about you and I think at the end of the day, you really need to focus on what you want and keep working. Keep working , keep working hard.</p>
<cite>Jaclyn Victor</cite></blockquote>



<p>Based on Victor’s achievements after winning Malaysian Idol, she truly walked the talk.</p>



<p>Her debut album “Gemilang” under Sony BMG won the Best Pop Album and Album of the Year awards in Anugerah Industri Muzik 2005 (Malaysia’s equivalent of the Grammy Awards). The title track in the album also won the main prize at Anugerah Juara Lagu in 2005.</p>



<p>The highlight of her career was performing at the 2011 and 2017 SEA Games. She only filmed her first proper music video in 2006 for the song “Ceritera Cinta” with Indonesian singer Rio Febrian.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fkFhkGdhzc?si=gZSwk4V4fIZOlawW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>She also started her own music label Rag Doll Record and self-produced her single “Kembalilah” in 2023. This year, she released two singles: &#8220;Sesal Tak Bermakna&#8221; in August and an English funk-tinged dance track &#8220;B.D.T.&#8221; in November.</p>



<p>Victor has gone on to win several more awards for her musical works. As of 2024, she has won 10 Anugerah Industri Muzik, 5 awards in Anugerah Juara Lagu 2, Anugerah Bintang Popular, 2 Anugerah Planet Muzik, and an Anugerah Skrin. </p>



<p>Additionally, she won &#8220;Most Promising Actress&#8221; for her role in the film Talentime at the 2009 Malaysian Film Festival.</p>



<p>In short, she’s one of the most acclaimed and successful music artists in Malaysia.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>A Dublin-based child psychiatrist named Amirul Arif Mohd Yunos, 38, was sentenced to prison by a court in Ireland after he was found guilty of grooming and sexually abusing a 15-year-old teenage girl, leaving her with &#8220;painful and grave trauma&#8221;.</p>



<p>While his name does sound like he is a Malaysian Malay, we can&#8217;t at this time verify this matter.</p>

<p>Amirul pleaded guilty to six counts of engaging in a sexual act with a child under 17, one count of sexual exploitation of a child, and one of meeting a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;The abuse started with inappropriate touching, before escalating into oral sex and penetration,&#8221; said the Irish news outlet.</p>



<p>The victim impact statement, read to the court by the prosecution counsel, the girl said the abuse had left her with &#8220;painful and grave trauma&#8221;, and she blames herself as she felt she &#8220;induced&#8221; the abuse and &#8220;deserved it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Dublin Circuit Criminal Court judge Orla Crowe was reported saying Amirul is &#8220;very fortunate his community and wife has stood by him&#8221;, referring to the testimonials submitted to the court.</p>



<p>Judge Crowe also said the court had reviewed testimonials, Amirul Arif’s apology letter, and a psychological report.</p>



<p>She highlighted that the psychological report mentioned he had a “promising career” but due to his crimes, he will not be able to work in this field in Ireland in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The judge imposed a sentence of eight and a half years, backdated to when he went into custody.</p>

<p>Last October, JPJ was accepting bids for &#8216;MADANI&#8217; Special Registration Numbers (NPI) and the public jumped on the opportunity to bid for &#8216;MADANI 8481&#8217; and &#8216;MADANI 8055&#8217; number plates.</p>



<p>The minimum bid price for the number plate series was according to category, namely RM20,000 (Main Number), RM5,000 (Premium Number), RM2,500 (Attractive Number), RM500 (Popular Number), and RM100 (Running Number).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.malaysianow.com/my/news/2024/10/24/siapakah-pemilik-nombor-plat-madani-8481-bernilai-rm26666">Malaysia Now</a> reported that the final bid for &#8216;MADANI 8481&#8217; was successfully made a minute before the auction was closed.

<p>Vivy Yusof, the founder of online fashion retail brand FashionValet, and her husband Datuk Fadzaruddin Shah Anuar will be charged in court on Thursday (5 December).</p>



<p>The couple is being charged in connection with the loss of investment funds of Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah) and Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) in FashionValet, amounting up to RM43.9 million.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="886" src="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-931583" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM.png 900w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-300x295.png 300w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-768x756.png 768w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-90x90.png 90w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-370x364.png 370w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-800x788.png 800w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-20x20.png 20w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-740x728.png 740w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-10.33.19 AM-49x48.png 49w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>This was confirmed by the Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Tan Sri Azam Baki, according to a <a href="https://www.bernama.com/radio/news.php?id=2370762">Bernama report</a> yesterday (3 December).</p>



<p>He said the MACC arrested the couple yesterday afternoon, but both were given bail to appear in court tomorrow.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.astroawani.com/videos/video-terkini-x7sio1/vivy-yusof-dan-suami-akan-didakwa-atas-pecah-amanah-khamis-ini-x9a6gug">Astro Awani</a> reported that the couple will be charged under the offense of breach of trust.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why are they being charged for the loss?</h2>



<p>On 28 October, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in a written parliamentary reply that two government-linked firms &#8211; Khazanah and PNB &#8211; had sold their minority investments in FashionValet at the end of 2023 for RM3.1 million.</p>



<p>The sale marked a significant loss from the initial RM47 million investments in 2018, prompting calls for investigations as it involves public money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="939" height="677" src="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-931585" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4.png 939w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-300x216.png 300w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-768x554.png 768w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-370x267.png 370w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-800x577.png 800w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-740x534.png 740w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-20x14.png 20w, https://www.therakyatpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-4-67x48.png 67w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px" /></figure>



<p>On 7 November, the MACC confirmed it found several suspicious transactions made to a company linked to the founding partner of FashionValet from 2018 until last year, though it didn&#8217;t say who.</p>



<p>Azam told local media at the time, that they believe some investments have been misused in the matter, and they were trying to identify it.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2022/08/05/fashionvalets-pivot-to-duck-lilit-backed-by-investors-says-vivy-yusof/21025">report by Malay Mail</a> on 5 August, 2022, there have been allegations that FashionValet heavily promoted its two in-house brands &#8211; dUCK and Lilit &#8211; at the expense of other local vendors that used its platform to sell their products, even as the firm marketed itself as a business model around promoting local entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>It was also reported that announcements of FashionValet&#8217;s closure of its e-commerce platform in 2022 had raised eyebrows on how a business that was recording multi-million dollar losses could convince two of the country&#8217;s largest state investment funds to inject money into it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MOF reveals three factors that were the cause of FashionValet&#8217;s losses</h2>



<p>Earlier, Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan, when answering a question from Bukit Bendera Member of Parliament Syarleen Abdul Rashid, outlined three factors that were the cause of FashionValet&#8217;s losses.</p>



<p>The causes were: Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, changing trends of e-commerce platforms, and challenges in terms of fundraising.</p>



<p>This controversy also caught the attention of Deputy Speaker Yang Di-Pertua Dewan Rakyat Datuk Ramli Mohd Nor, when he questioned whether the investment received by FashionValet from Khazanah was approved by the MOF.</p>



<p>Ramli explained that he who used to work as an investigator described the loss of public funds worth more than RM40 million was absurd.</p>

<p>Sara, the missing British Shorthair cat in Putrajaya, has been reunited with her owner Twitter user Mita (@ansamr_) &nbsp;after disappearing from a petsitter’s house.</p>



<p>Mita shared the joyous update with her followers and thanked everyone who has supported her and tried to search for her missing cat for the past two weeks.</p>



<p>On 1 December 2024, a man named Akmal found her cat after it fell from the bottom of a black MPV.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="in" dir="ltr">I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE YANG TERLIBAT SECARA LANGSUNG ATAU TIDAK LANGSUNG DALAM USAHA MENCARI SARA. <br><br>Orang sgt baik dengan kami, kami tak dpt balas dengan apa tapi hanyalah doa semoga semua yang telah bantu kami walau dengan rt sahaja pun semoga urusan dipermudahkan <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f-1f3fb.png" alt="🙏🏻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/1qrbqF4OFv">https://t.co/1qrbqF4OFv</a> <a href="https://t.co/rOFl2T9lKM">pic.twitter.com/rOFl2T9lKM</a></p>&mdash; mita (@ansamr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/ansamr_/status/1863874411197354111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Akmal’s mother contacted Mita to let her know the good news. Mita shared that she and her husband rushed to Putrajaya and found that it was indeed their missing cat.</p>



<p>Mita said Sara was still traumatised and had grown skinny due to being outdoors for more than two weeks.</p>



<p>While this chapter has closed, Mita reiterated her gratitude for all the help and support she received from strangers who made the effort to reach out and provide aid.</p>



<p>In another post, Mita shared that she had taken the cat to the vet. The vet shared that Mita needs to provide her cat with lots of love and time to decompress to recover from trauma. </p>



<p>Mita added that her cat still refused to eat her old food. She believes the cat negatively associated the food with the pet boarding place so she would keep monitoring her cat during the recovery process.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brought Sara to the vet. Doctor said that she’s very very traumatised. Have to let her decompress and give her lots of love <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f62d.png" alt="😭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f932.png" alt="🤲" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br><br>I have to monitor her for now.

<p>Previously, Mita was devastated to find out her cat had gone missing from the pet sitter&#8217;s house. She left her cat with a pet sitter because she was travelling abroad with her husband for an extended time.</p>



<p>Mita and her husband landed in Malaysia on 17 November and were on their way to collect their cat on the same day when the pet sitter informed her what had happened.</p>



<p>However, the pet sitter was allegedly unhelpful when Mita and her husband attempted to reach an understanding with the pet sitter.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>In a tale that hits close to home for Malaysian travellers, a humble Lawson convenience store in Fujikawaguchiko is teaching us hard lessons about travel etiquette and cultural respect &#8211; while making us reflect on our own iconic mountain views back home.</p>



<p>The town of Fujikawaguchiko in Yamanashi Prefecture has decided to re-install barriers in front of the Lawson convenience store near Kawaguchiko Station, which has become overwhelmed with foreign tourists seeking to photograph Mount Fuji. </p>



<p>The decision comes as tourists continue to cross the road for photos dangerously.</p>



<p>While this was a &#8220;difficult decision&#8221; as it affects the store&#8217;s parking lot entrance, officials deemed strong measures necessary due to ongoing rule violations.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">バニラカーの出番<br><br>コンビニ富士山の撮影防ぐ幕「再設置しない」　富士河口湖町長が表明(朝日新聞デジタル)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Yahoo%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Yahooニュース</a><a href="https://t.co/1OIkYphWuG">https://t.co/1OIkYphWuG</a></p>&mdash; おのみりゅうじ (@ryujionomi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryujionomi/status/1864106341201273160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Barrier Battle: A Timeline of Lawson&#8217;s Tourist Troubles</h3>



<p>The town installed a black screen (20 meters wide and 2.5 meters high) along the opposite sidewalk in May. </p>



<p>At that time, they also installed protective barriers (80 cm high) on the sidewalk across from the store. </p>



<p>However, they couldn&#8217;t install barriers on the convenience store side due to the parking lot entrance.</p>



<p>The screen was removed in August due to an approaching typhoon and was kept down to monitor tourist behaviour. </p>



<p>However, disruptive behaviour by foreign tourists has continued.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When Mountain Views Tell Different Stories</h3>



<p>This story resonates particularly with Malaysians, <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/17/haro-konnichiwa-hisashiburi-malaysian-visitors-to-japan-on-steady-rise-39000-in-sept-and-over-310000-so-far-and-the-year-isnt-ended-yet/153925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most enthusiastic Southeast Asian tourist groups in Japan</a>. </p>



<p>The irony isn&#8217;t lost on us—while Japan grapples with tourists behaving badly at a convenience store with a Fuji view, we have dozens of shops, &#8216;kedai runcit&#8217;, and warungs in Kundasang, Sabah, with equally spectacular views of Mount Kinabalu—our own towering pride and <a href="https://everything-everywhere.com/unesco-world-heritage-sites-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malaysia&#8217;s first UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.</p>



<p>Yet they remain peaceful community spaces rather than tourist battlegrounds.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fascinating how things play out differently.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Malaysian Hospitality: From Plastic Chairs to Shared Stories</h3>



<p>If a convenience store in Kundasang became famous for its mountain view, the owner would probably add more plastic chairs outside and start selling nasi lemak. We&#8217;d turn it into a proper &#8216;lepak&#8217; (hangout) spot!</p>



<p>Malaysian tourists in Japan have generally earned a favourable reputation compared to other nationalities. </p>



<p>Our inherent &#8220;sopan santun&#8221; and understanding of Asian values often help us navigate Japanese cultural sensitivities better than Western tourists. </p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because we understand the concept of community spaces—after all, our mamak stalls and kedai kopis are more than just shops; they&#8217;re social hubs where tourists and locals naturally blend.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3Dpfbid05L7EamUWdE3crXpfJywKiNqxEimyzJYYGykJBjEuV9QjtxVYnRBfUqsW22JXFTTzl%26id%3D100064818365705&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500" width="500" height="250" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lessons from Lawson: When Malaysian Manners Matter Most</h3>



<p>The Lawson incident is both a warning and a reminder of what we&#8217;re doing right. </p>



<p>While Japan struggles with overtourism at its convenience stores, our mountain-view spots maintain their charm through natural Malaysian hospitality. </p>



<p>A kedai runcit owner in Kundasang would more likely solve problems with a friendly &#8220;mari-mari minum kopi&#8221; than with a six-meter fence.</p>



<p>For Malaysians planning their next Japan trip, it&#8217;s a reminder that sometimes the best photos are the ones we don&#8217;t take, and the best memories are made when we remember we&#8217;re guests in someone else&#8217;s home. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, perhaps we should appreciate how our own communities naturally balance tourism and local life &#8211; where a convenience store with a mountain view remains just that, a community space where everyone&#8217;s welcome, as long as they remember their manners.</p>

<p>The donation was channelled through Khairul Aming’s humanitarian initiative, BOB (Bantuan Orang Baik), aimed at bringing aid to those affected by the devastating floods. </p>



<p>The donation included NUUNA, ecoBrown’s BRICE, and ecoBrown’s PLUS, which arrived at Luxury Garden on 2 and 3 December. This central location serves as the hub for BOB, where volunteers and supplies gather to coordinate assistance to impacted communities.</p>

<p>Culinary influencer Khairul Aming recently ran a relief effort for flood victims in Kelantan, providing food and other essentials for those who are staying in Temporary Relief Centres (PPS).</p>



<p>However, one village chief at a PPS in the town of Tumpat allegedly had his own ideas of distributing the supplies.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user34417455075593/video/7443766977597902087?_r=1&amp;_t=8rtyB0cgfVS">video</a> posted on TikTok by one of the flood victims at the PPS went viral after they expressed their disappointment and questioned the <em>tok penghulu&#8217;s</em> (village chief&#8217;s) methods of distributing essential supplies provided by Khairul.</p>



<p>The footage shows a group of individuals who appear to be unpacking the aid supplies and repackaging them into separate plastic bags, allegedly under the instructions of the village chief.</p>



<p>The victim claimed that all they recieved were dry biscuits and instant noodle packets, while the rest of the items were kept away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really bad, staying here [at the PPS], a lot of supplies arrived but so little was distributed.</p>



<p>&#8220;This village chief is the worst. I don&#8217;t deny that considering the season, there&#8217;s not enough food but there&#8217;s a lot that was given, but what was distributed is so little. They were willing to ration the supplies like in the video,&#8221; the video caption wrote.</p>



<p>Additionally, they said that in all their years of experience, their PPS cards would be marked to show that they have received aid supplies. This time however, the cards were marked but they did not receive the promised supplies.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have asked the village chief, but he said the aid from Khairul Aming is his responsibility so he could do whatever he sees fit,&#8221; the evacuee added.</p>



<p>Netizens were quick to condemn the actions of the village chief, saying that he has breached the trust of Khairul who provided enough supplies for everyone at the PPS.</p>



<p>Some comments revealed that Khairul had already packaged the supplies for each individual or family, and did not allow anyone else other than the victims to open the packages.</p>



<p>In fact, a volunteer also commented on the video, saying the same thing.</p>

<p>Yesterday (2 December), Khairul Aming executed a relief operation in Kelantan, providing aid to more than 7,000 victims in 17 critical locations around the state.</p>



<p>He had set up a drop-off point where those who wanted to donate food, clothes, personal care products, blankets and other essential items can bring them over, and his team of volunteers would head out in 4&#215;4 trucks to distribute them at temporary relief shelters.</p>

<p>The celebrity chef has since responded to the situation in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khairulamingfans_/video/7444031389328067858?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121487129%3Bnull%3Bembed_masking&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=ohmedia.my%2Ftrending%2Ftular-isu-pembahagian-bantuan-banjir-di-pps-ini-respon-khairul-aming%2F&amp;referer_video_id=7444031389328067858">TikTok video</a>.</p>



<p>In the response post, Khairul said he had received the complaints, but would prefer not to be involved.</p>



<p>He stressed that he and his team&#8217;s responsibilites are only to deliver the supplies to the PPS and move on to the next location.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that really happened, make a police report. Other than that, Team KA cannot be involved and we do not have any info (on the incident),&#8221; Khairul said in the response video.</p>



<p>He also said that he would rather not get involved in matters that could bring about defamation due to lack of authentic information.</p>



<p>Khairul mentioned he once faced a situation where a committee member (AJK) at a PPS cried and complained that she was accused for hiding things when she herself did not have enough to eat.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example at the PPS yesterday, the AJK lady cried saying someone accused her of hiding supplies.</p>



<p>&#8220;She said she and her child themselves did not have enough to eat. So once again, I do not want to get involved and will not allow my team to get involved as the only info we have is, we drop off the things and go. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; Khairul explained.</p>



<p>He then apologised for being unable to focus on all the issues that occured because he was busy with the mission of channeling donations.</p>

<p>In light of the bullying cases at the National Defence University of Malaysia (UPNM), Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar warned the university to stop associating his name with the institution if it fails to eradicate its culture of bullying and abuse.</p>



<p>During his proclamation as UPNM Chancellor and the 14<sup>th</sup> convocation ceremony, he expressed sadness over the past cases of abuse that had resulted in injuries and deaths and asked commanders and officers to take responsibility or resign if they failed their duties.</p>



<p>He said parents sent their children to UPNM to become military officers and not to be abused.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>UPNM’s philosophy is to be a leading university in defence, military and security studies. Military discipline and culture are core to this institution.</p>
<cite>Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar</cite></blockquote>



<p>He acknowledged that cadets will go through physical and mental training but it does not constitute abuse or lead to injuries or deaths.</p>

<p>He criticised the university for failing to make a serious effort to manage the issue, citing how previous cases had been brought to court and yet the issue repeats every year.</p>

<p>The King also urged the Defence Ministry to prioritise action on a recent bullying case where a cadet suffered fractured ribs and spinal injury after getting stomped by a senior student.</p>



<p>The 21 October incident which involved a 19-year-old cadet and a third-year student, is being investigated under Section 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt.</p>

<p>Did you forget to wish a friend <strong>“Happy Birthday”</strong>on their special day? What do you say to them a day later? If it’s <strong>“Happy Belated Birthday”</strong>, this Malaysian newsman points out that you&#8217;ve been saying it wrong.</p>



<p>Former Bernama Radio24 COO Sheikh Raffie Abd Rahman shared on his Tiktok <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shakeroughy?_t=8rtoRPw4vrj&amp;_r=1">@shakeroughy</a> that the term <strong>“Happy Belated Birthday”</strong> is wrong? And the correct way of saying it is actually <strong>“Belated Happy Birthday”</strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@shakeroughy/video/7443630313982479624" data-video-id="7443630313982479624" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px;min-width:325px"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@shakeroughy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shakeroughy?refer=embed" rel="noopener">@shakeroughy</a> <p>“Happy Belated Birthday” is wrong. <a title="betulkanyangbiasabiasakanyangbetul" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/betulkanyangbiasabiasakanyangbetul?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#betulkanyangbiasabiasakanyangbetul</a> <a title="correctthenormalnormalisethecorrect" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/correctthenormalnormalisethecorrect?refer=embed" rel="noopener">#correctthenormalnormalisethecorrect</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - SheikhRaffie ShakeRoughy - SheikhRaffie ShakeRoughy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-SheikhRaffie-ShakeRoughy-7443630395969374992?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound &#8211; SheikhRaffie ShakeRoughy &#8211; SheikhRaffie ShakeRoughy</a> </section> </blockquote>



<p>Sheikh Raffie who is always sharing pronunciation videos on TikTok further elaborated by saying that <strong>“Happy Belated Birthday”</strong> is wrong as it is stating the the birthday is late. When in fact it is the wish that has come late. The correct way would be putting the word <strong>“belated”</strong> first, as that is the word modifying the term <strong>“happy birthday</strong>”.</p>



<p>Sheikh Raffie has an extensive amount of experience working in radio and television as a journalist and broadcast media specialist in some noteworthy places such as the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commision (MCMC) as well as NTV7 and Radio24. </p>



<p>The well-trained linguist now uses his spare time teaching proper pronunciation and grammar to the masses, using TikTok as a medium. His recent video, being the “Happy Belated Birthday” dilemma has sparked conversation on the comments of the video, with speculations of the correct way of phrasing the term.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The infamous Mohammad Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, former sixth Prime Minister of Malaysia, is known for many things. Most of them are not good things, but that&#8217;s what makes him such a storied individual in Malaysia&#8217;s history so far.</p>



<p>Yesterday (2 December), Najib was in court to defend himself against 25 criminal charges in the 1Malaysia Development Board (1MDB) trial.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been out of the loop or simply forgot what this man had done to single-handedly anger the government and so many people, Najib got into hot soup when around US$681 million (RM2 billion) of alleged 1MDB funds entered his personal AmIslamic bank account.</p>



<p>However, the reason he was jailed was because he was convicted in a separate case for abusing his position at the 1MDB-linked SRC International Sdn Bhd involving RM42 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Crash course on Najib&#8217;s 1MDB trial</h2>



<p>Back in 2018, Najib was charged for abusing his roles as prime minister, finance minister, and 1MDB&#8217;s board of advisers&#8217; chairman over 1MDB matters for his own benefit amounting to RM2.27 billion, as well as money laundering over RM2 billion belonging to 1MDB.</p>



<p>The 1MDB trial began in August 2019 with multiple disruptions along the way. One of the reasons being the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Over five years of trial until May 30, 2024, the prosecution brought 50 prosecution witnessses and evidence, such as banking documents.</p>



<p>Some of the prosecution witnesses included Najib&#8217;s former special officers, various banks&#8217; former and current officers, a former Bank Negara Malaysia governor, a former finance minister II, and a former chief secretary to the government.</p>



<p>Then, on 30 October, the High Court ordered Najib to to enter his defence, as it found the prosecution had shown credible evidence he must rebut if he doesn&#8217;t want to be found guilty of the 25 charges.</p>



<p>He was given the choice to either testify on oath in the witness stand, remain silent (which would automatically result in a conviction), or give an unsworn statement from the accused&#8217;s dock (which would be given less value by the court).</p>



<p>Najib chose to testify in the witness stand that day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what will happen after Najib and his defence witnesses testify</h2>



<p>Najib will have to sum up his defence, with his lawyers and and the prosecution to present their final arguments to the High Court.</p>



<p>If the High Court decides Najib has cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution&#8217;s case, he will be acquitted of the charges.</p>



<p>Conversely, if the High Court finds the prosecution&#8217;s case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, he will be found guilty and sentenced.</p>



<p>All this will only come after Najib concludes his defence.</p>



<p>The High Court has scheduled 97 hearing days for Najib&#8217;s defence in the 1MDB trial starting from yesterday to this Friday (2 &#8211; 6 December) and all of next week (9 &#8211; 13 December).</p>



<p>The trials is expected to resume in 2025 from January to April, and then continued in May, June, August, September, October, and November.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Najib&#8217;s criminal cases and their current status?</h2>



<p>Najib has been involved in five criminal cases, with two cases ongoing in court:</p>



<p>1. The RM2.27 billion 1MDB trial he is defending himself in.</p>



<p>2. His RM27 million money laundering case over former 1MDB subsidiary SRC International Sdn Bhd, which the trial is set to start on 21 April, 2025.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>Three of his other criminal cases which are concluded or no longer pending are:</p>



<p>1. The RM42 million SRC International Sdn Bhd case</p>



<p>Najib was imprisoned in the Kajang Prison since August 2022 because of this case. His prison sentence was halved from 12 years to six by the Federal Territories Pardons Board this year, and his RM210 million fine was reduced to RM50 million.</p>



<p>2. 1MDB audit report case</p>



<p>The High Court acquitted Najib and 1MDB&#8217;s ex-CEO Arul Kandasamy in March 2023, as the prosecution failed to prove a case for them to defend themselves against.</p>



<p>3. 1MDB-linked case of criminal breach of trust involving RM6.6 billion in government funds.<strong><br></strong><br>On 27 November, the High Court granted Najib and ex-Treasury Secretary-General Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, partly because the trial could not start due to procedural issues. This means that the trial is over for now but the prosecution could press the same charges against them later.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happened on the first day of Najib&#8217;s defence?</h2>



<p>The former prime minister finally started his defence yesterday, six years after he was charged with abuse of power and money laundering over RM2 billion of 1MDB&#8217;s funds.</p>



<p>He began with reading his 525-page witness statement that was prepared while he was in prison.</p>



<p>During his defence, Najib brought up the fact that he was not the only person to have held the position of both prime minister and finance minister at the same time.</p>



<p>He noted that Malaysia&#8217;s first prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman also held both positions simultaneously during his tenure from 1970 to 1976.</p>



<p>&#8220;This was later continued by other leaders, including Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who briefly assumed the finance portfolio in the 1990s, if I&#8217;m not mistaken during the Asian Financial Crisis, and Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,&#8221; he said in a <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/02/najib-begins-reading-his-525-page-witness-statement-in-1mdb-trial-says-wasnt-first-to-wear-double-pm-mof-hat/158665">Malay Mail</a> report.</p>



<p>Apart from that, he also <a href="https://www.hmetro.com.my/mutakhir/2024/12/1161733/saya-tidak-pernah-jejak-ke-bank-amislamic-najib">denied ever having set foot in AmIslamic Bank</a> on Jalan Raja Chulan, which he was accused of in the RM2 billion 1MDB and SRC International Sdn Bhd embezzlement scandal.</p>



<p>On one of the money laundering charges involving RM60.6 million, Najib told the High Court that the sum which entered his personal AmIslamic account was a <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/12/02/1mdb-trial-rm606mil-in-my-bank-account-a-donation-from-late-saudi-king-says-najib">donation</a> from the late Saudi king, King Abdullah.</p>



<p>He testified that there were remittances from Prince Faisal bin Turki bin Bandar Al-Saud and Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and he did inform the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) of his beliefs these remittances were donations from the late King Abdullah to &#8220;assist&#8221; him in the 13th General Election in 2013.</p>



<p>This is a developing story, with more updates to come as the trial continues.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>The Communications and Multimedia (Amendment) Bill 2024 which was recently presented in Parliament could protect satirical and parody works in arts and literature according to Bangi MP Syahredzan Johan.</p>



<p>The relevance of this new law is related to an old case involving controversial Malaysian street artist Fahmi Reza, known for his satirical artworks that “punch up.” It’s no surprise that those in authority didn’t appreciate it much.</p>



<p>In 2016, Fahmi was charged at the Ipoh Sessions Court under Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (Act 588) for sending false communications with the intention to offend others.</p>



<p>For those who don’t remember, Fahmi made a parody post seemingly issued by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (SKMM). It was made to criticise SKMM and the authorities back then. P.S: The keyword is &#8220;clown.&#8221;</p>



<p>SKMM claimed Fahmi spread false information because they didn’t issue that notice.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="in" dir="ltr">Kes badut hampir tamat. Aku pilih untuk bagi keterangan secara bersumpah dalam mahkamah untuk bela diri aku dan bela karya parodi yang aku hasilkan. Sekarang keputusan terletak di tangan hakim. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KitaSemuaPenghasut?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KitaSemuaPenghasut</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clowntrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#clowntrial</a> <a href="https://t.co/cGZyJ1yXOo">pic.twitter.com/cGZyJ1yXOo</a></p>&mdash; Fahmi Reza (@kuasasiswa) <a href="https://twitter.com/kuasasiswa/status/950643256815058946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>Syahredzan, representing Fahmi in court, argued that the post was a parody and could not be considered a false transmission or an offence under Section 233.</p>



<p>However, the judge found that there was a prima facie case and stated that there’s no provision under Act 588 that provides parody as a defence. In other words, a parody or satirical work is considered a criminal offence if it meets the elements of Section 233.</p>



<p>This ruling resulted in Fahmi facing imprisonment for a month and a fine of RM30,000. If he fails to pay the fine, he risks a 6-month jail term.</p>



<p>After appealing the High Court, the prison sentence was set aside and the fine was reduced to RM10,000. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence given by the High Court.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does the amendment help protect satirical and parody works?</h3>



<p>Syahredzan referred to Clause 91 of the Communications and Multimedia (Amendment) Bill 2024 which proposed amendments to Section 233, which includes Descriptions explaining elements such as obscenity, false, threatening, or disgusting in nature.</p>



<p>Under the Descriptions, satirical or parody content or content that is clearly fictional is not false. Syahredzan explained that if this bill is passed, satirical and parody works like the ones made by Fahmi eight years ago will not be considered an offence under Section 233.</p>



<p>Syahredzan added that there are more suggested changes in the Bill amendments but he wouldn’t touch on those in the same post for the time being.</p>



<p>Syahredzan added that the Bill showed that the government recognizes that both satirical and parody works are legitimate forms of criticism or commentary and are not crimes that need to be punished.</p>



<p>He reiterated that if the Bill is passed, satirical and parody works in the arts and literature scene will be more protected, “as it should be.”</p>

<p>An Indonesian woman recently declared that it would be her first and last time visiting Johor Bahru after her experience at the bus station during her recent visit in Malaysia.</p>



<p>Posting on TikTok, Najla (@najlaindah_) explained that she loves Malaysia, especially its health tourism, and would recommend that to anyone she knows and meets. She shared that her mother gets medical treatment in Malaysia too.</p>



<p>However, she wasn’t happy with the bus service she received here. During her recent trip, she booked a bus ticket from Johor to Kuala Lumpur due to changes to her flight schedule. It was also an opportunity for her to experience travelling on land across different Malaysian states.</p>

Even my mom get her medical treatment in here.  But today, my disapointment above the head. We book a bus from Johor to KL simply because the flight schedule is not fit with us and we want to experience the land travel. Our bus supposed to arrived at 16.49, but until 18.57 our bus in not arrived yet and we got ZERO information, everytime we ask they keep throwing us here and there, no one know anything. I ask them what the solutions they can give? My friend record it for a prove, because we have wait for 3 hours with no information given to us.  Suddenly, a guy attack my friend, and drag him out harshly because he want us to delete the video. I followed him outside and someone claim as a “police” and threaten my friend to delete the video, and I know he is NOT a police so I ask him to show his police ID, and he shouted me very harshly. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f974.png" alt="🥴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> This whole experience itself totally not okay. With all do respect, no more Johor. </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound  - ig : @najlaindah &#x1f54a;" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-ig-najlaindah-&#x1f54a;-7443409375427463937?refer=embed" rel="noopener">♬ original sound  &#8211; ig : @najlaindah <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f54a.png" alt="🕊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>



<p>The bus was supposed to arrive at 4.49pm, but it was nowhere to be seen at 6.57pm. She was disappointed that passengers were given no information, and when she enquired, she claimed they were given the runaround.</p>



<p>She asked for solutions and her friend made a video recording to prove they had waited for the bus for three hours with no information updates.</p>



<p>Najla claimed a man suddenly attacked her friend and dragged him out to force them to delete the video recording.</p>



<p>When she followed them outside, someone else claimed they were the police and threatened her friend to delete the video.</p>



<p>Najla knew they weren’t cops and asked for their police ID. When she did, they shouted at her.</p>



<p>Najla said the whole experience was “totally not okay” and reiterated that she wouldn’t return to Johor next time.</p>



<p>In the comments, netizens asked whether it happened at Larkin bus terminal because apparently, it’s the norm for buses to be late there.</p>



<p>Some claimed the staff there are also rude and unhelpful to locals so they weren’t surprised a tourist like Najla was treated similarly.</p>



<p>A netizen shared how she and her boyfriend had to fork out extra money to get physical bus tickets despite buying online tickets. The staff also refused to give them back their change although there was clearly enough small change in the drawer.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, others advised Najla not to tar all Johoreans the same. They pointed out that it was a recurring issue in Johor Bahru and not in other states like Muar and Segamat.</p>



<p>In response, Najla apologised and thanked them for correcting her. She also explained that she used Johor as a short form for Johor Bahru.</p>
