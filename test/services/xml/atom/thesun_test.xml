<p>Winter is the time for giving our bodies some extra TLC, as the cold weather is often the cause of dry skin.</p>



<p>The new Sol de Janeiro additions are designed help keep skin feeling nourished all season, with hydrating formulas that contain 50% glycerin and a combination of Brazilian oils.</p>



<p>Sol de Janeiro&#8217;s products are probably best-known for their wonderful scents &#8211; and the set&#8217;s Cheirosa 59&#8242; contains top notes of velvet plum and sugar violet.</p>



<p>Complemented with middle notes of vanilla orchid and whipped amber, it&#8217;s finished with sheer sandalwood and fresh vetiver at the base.</p>



<p>Sol de Janiero&#8217;s body butter has gone viral in the past for its velvety texture and long-lasting fragrance. </p>



<p>The body cream is designed to lock in moisture with its nourishing texture, while working to support the skin&#8217;s natural skin barrier. </p>



<p>The <a aria-label="Cheirosa 59' Body Butter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=59805&amp;awinaffid=255437&amp;clickref=sol-de-janerio-set-32126269&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spacenk.com%2Fuk%2Fbath-body%2Fbody-moisturiser-oils%2Fbody-creme-butter%2Fdelicia-drench-body-butter-UK200041106.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Cheirosa &#8217;59 Body Butter</a> received an average 4.6-out-of-five rating from Space NK shoppers.</p>



<p>One reviewer wrote: &#8220;I love the original cream, so I thought I&#8217;d give this one a try too, and I honestly think I love it even more.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still really moisturising, but with a scent that&#8217;s a little less heavy with the inclusion of some florals &#8211; which feels even more fitting in during colder months.&#8221;</p>



<p>Created with high-quality Brazilian ingredients, the cream can be layered over the Sol de Janeiro shower oil for an elevated, longer-lasting scent. </p>

<p>The experts at <a href="https://www.vegasslotsonline.com/uk/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">VSO</a> have created a Christmas-themed mind-bender that will puzzle even the biggest festive fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s sure to put your observation skills to the ultimate test this festive season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whilst this picture has a large selection of beautiful <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/homes/">homes</a> with stunning Christmas trees in the windows, one of them has not yet got round to putting their tree up.</p>



<p>Everyone can see the houses, but only those with 20/20 vision can spot the festive house without a Christmas tree in under 26 seconds.</p>



<p>But be careful, as there’s colourful doors and bow displays to confuse you.</p>



<p>So are you eager to see if you’ve got razor sharp vision?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is the time to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/puzzles/" rel="">put your eyesight to the test</a>.</p>



<p>Set yourself a timer and try not to get too distracted by the pretty snowflakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve got less than 30 seconds and according to the pros at <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.vegasslotsonline.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">VSO</a>, many people have struggled to spot the house with <span id="7ab826f7-ea18-4c33-b7c7-a27a40ff6cb8" class="suggested-link">the missing</span> Christmas tree in this <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/optical-illusion/">optical illusion</a>.</p>



<p>Some puzzlers have quit their search for the tree even before running out of time to beat the record.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/quizzes-puzzles-brain-teasers/]">Brainteasers</a> are excellent for your noggin because they stimulate cognitive function, improve problem-solving skills and enhance overall mental agility.</p>



<p>They challenge <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/quizzes-puzzles-brain-teasers/">different areas of the brain</a>, including memory, logic and spatial reasoning &#8211; similar to optical illusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result? Improved neuroplasticity, which is the brain&#8217;s ability to adapt and form new neural connections.</p>



<p>Activities like brainteasers, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/quizzes-puzzles-brain-teasers/">puzzles and riddles</a> require you to think critically, which also sharpens your analytical and reasoning skills.</p>



<p>Some studies even suggest that challenging your brain with teasers may help delay age-related cognitive decline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A WOMAN has opened up about her struggle with severe hair loss, losing up to 70% of her hair, but thanks to three simple lifestyle changes, her hair grew back quickly.</p>



<p>Deepa Berar went through a dramatic <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hair/">hair</a> transformation and now proudly flaunts thick, healthy brunette hair. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32126278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32126278" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/i-even-lost-70-hair-954736915.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32126278" width="540" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32126278" class="wp-caption-text">Deepa lost 70% of her hair but now has luscious brunette locks</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32126298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32126298" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/i-even-lost-70-hair-954736918.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32126298" width="540" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32126298" class="wp-caption-text">Thanks to three crucial life changes, Deepa managed to have quick regrowth</figcaption></figure>



<p>She credits her success to a routine that had her hair regrowing within just two months.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.treatmentroomslondon.com/hair-loss/uk-hair-loss-facts-statistics/#:~:text=Female%20hair%20loss%20statistics%20While%20many%20of,80%20with%20a%20full%20head%20of%20hair." target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Treatment Rooms London</a>, about 40% of women show signs of hair loss by the age of 50. </p>



<p>Deepa shared her journey on her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a> account, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deepa.berar/video/7324367653940825386?q=hair%20loss%20hacks&amp;t=1733387243792" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="‘deepa.berar’, (opens in a new tab)">‘deepa.berar’,</a> where she explained how hormonal hair loss affected her, a condition that millions of people face.</p>



<p>She said: “[My hair] was super thin, then I went through another alopecia areata flare. </p>



<p>&#8220;This wasn’t my first time. I first experienced alopecia areata back in 2016. </p>



<p>&#8220;Both times, I lost 70% of my hair, but this time I knew exactly what to do because I had regrown it before.”</p>



<p>An alopecia areata flare occurs when someone with the condition experiences a sudden, severe loss of hair. </p>



<p>It’s an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the hair follicles, causing hair to fall out in small, round patches. </p>



<p>Flares can happen quickly and vary in severity, often triggered by stress, illness, or hormonal changes. </p>



<p>Though unpredictable, hair can eventually grow back, though flares can return from time to time.</p>

<p>For Deepa, three key changes <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/29597748/hair-growth-onion-hack-results-before-after/" rel="">helped her regrow her hair: </a>“One&nbsp;was&nbsp;supplementing&nbsp;my&nbsp;nutrient&nbsp;deficiencies.</p>



<p>&#8220;Second&nbsp;was&nbsp;to&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on&nbsp;stress&nbsp;management&nbsp;techniques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;And&nbsp;the&nbsp;third&nbsp;was&nbsp;going&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;AIP&nbsp;diet,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;gold&nbsp;standard&nbsp;when&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to&nbsp;autoimmune&nbsp;diseases.&#8221;</p>



<p>The AIP diet (Autoimmune Protocol Diet) is a strict elimination plan designed to reduce inflammation and support healing in people with autoimmune issues. It eliminates foods that could trigger immune responses, like grains, dairy, legumes, nightshades &#8211; such as tomatoes and peppers &#8211; processed foods, sugar, and alcohol. </p>

	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->




<p>The focus is on nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods such as lean meats, fish, vegetables (except nightshades), fruits, healthy fats like olive <span id="0252b761-93c2-41d3-9693-f6f66e8d3ef9" class="suggested-link">oil</span> and coconut oil, and bone broth.</p>



<p>Deepa wants to remind her 18.3k followers that hair regrowth is “absolutely possible” and encourages them “not to lose hope.”</p>

<p>&#8220;My inflammation markers have been super high for years, which probably makes it worse.”</p>

<p><strong>HAIR pro <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samantha.cusick/" target="_blank" aria-label="Samantha Cusick (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Samantha Cusick</a> has revealed everything you need to know about hair loss. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Does Hair Loss Happen?</strong></p>
<p>Hair loss can be influenced by so many factors, from genetics and hormone changes to lifestyle choices. </p>
<p>Stress, diet, and even hair care habits can all impact hair strength. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s perfectly normal to lose some hair each day, but sometimes the body can shed more than usual, responding to things like hormonal shifts or even life stressors.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Happens More This Time of Year</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever noticed your hair seems to shed more in autumn? That’s seasonal shedding! </p>
<p>During summer, we hold onto extra hair to protect our scalp from the sun. </p>
<p>As the weather cools, it’s like our body recalibrates and lets go of those extra strands. </p>
<p>Dry, cooler air can also make hair more brittle, making it easier to lose a little extra volume during these months.</p>
<p><strong>Hacks and Affordable Buys to Treat Hair loss</strong></p>
<p>The great news? You don’t need to spend a fortune on pricey treatments to support your hair. </p>
<p>Try daily scalp massages—they’re so simple but really help boost blood flow to the follicles. </p>
<p>Castor oil is another fantastic, budget-friendly option that’s rich in nutrients to strengthen your strands. </p>
<p>Adding a bit more protein to your diet and a biotin supplement can also work wonders for overall hair health.</p>
<p><strong>Products to Avoid</strong></p>
<p>Steer clear of products with high levels of alcohol, sulphates, and parabens &#8211; they can be drying and damage hair over time. </p>
<p>Heat styling and chemical treatments can also cause breakage, so try to use them sparingly. </p>
<p>Instead, look for gentle, hydrating formulas to support your scalp and keep hair healthier through the seasons.</p>

<p>PRINCE Harry threw Princess Kate under the bus and dragged the kids into his hurtful narrative, a royal expert has claimed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/prince-harry/">Duke of Sussex</a>&nbsp;stepped down from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/royal-family/">Royal Family</a>&nbsp;four years ago and has since made a number of&nbsp;shocking allegations about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/prince-william/">William</a> and Kate.</p>

<p>Harry and William were famously known for sharing a close bond but have reportedly not spoken to each other in two years.</p>



<p>The brothers fractured relationship shows no sign of healing despite the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/">health</a> troubles faced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/royal-family/">royal family</a>&nbsp;in 2024 &#8211; with the effects felt by the wider royal family including Kate.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/royal-exclusive/" rel="">The Sun&#8217;s Royal Exclusive Show,</a> royal reporter Bronte Coy asked royal reporter Richard Palmer and Vanity Fair&#8217;s Katie Nicholl about the relationships moving forward.</p>



<p>Nicholl noted how the Princess of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wales/">Wales</a> had often been a &#8220;peacemaker&#8221; when the two feuding brothers hadn&#8217;t been talking.</p>



<p>She told Bronte: &#8220;I remember watching that moment at the Duke of <span id="e067d7c5-a207-4172-a993-1a7f946188b2" class="suggested-link">Edinburgh</span>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/funeral/">funeral</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kate sort of ushered William and Harry together as they walked up the hill. Seeing her play that role of peacemaker when they weren&#8217;t talking.</p>



<p>&#8220;The problem has been that Kate&#8217;s been thrown under the bus by Harry, he&#8217;s said hurtful things about her, he&#8217;s brought the children into the narrative.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nicholl went on to say that she believes William is still likely to feel &#8220;very angry and betrayed&#8221;.</p>



<p>She continued: &#8220;Possibly the Princess of <span id="6318bb36-dd6d-4b24-9b22-210f148a1d68" class="suggested-link">Wales</span> is open to reconciliation in some form.</p>



<p>&#8220;I still feel it&#8217;s quite early but when you go through something like a cancer diagnosis, that sort of journey.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you confront your own mortality you realise it&#8217;s far too short for rifts and family feuds.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps she will play a role of healing at some point.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Princess of Wales, 42,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/32037750/princess-kate-message-carol-concert/">wrote a letter to guests</a>&nbsp;set to attend her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/">Christmas</a> carol concert at Westminster Abbey on Friday.</p>

<p>In it, she reflected on the true meaning of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas/">festive period</a>&nbsp;and called for &#8220;love, not fear&#8221; as well as kindness and empathy.</p>



<p>Royal reporter Bronte Coy suggested Kate&#8217;s words could be a sign that she&#8217;s willing to forgive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/prince-harry/">Harry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/meghan-markle/">Meghan</a>.</p>



<p>Royal reporter Richard Palmer, echoed her thoughts about forgiveness &#8211; but struggled to get confirmation from inside sources.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;I did think that when I saw &#8216;forgiveness&#8217;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I tried to sound out people close to [Kate] but they were adamant that they weren&#8217;t offering any guidance on what was the message behind the message.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes as <span id="3071e5e0-53ff-49f7-b3f2-b91cff23d76c" class="suggested-link">Prince</span> William and Prince Harry once again offered their congratulations separately to winners of the Diana Award, set up in memory of their mother.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/prince-william/">William</a>&nbsp;has written a letter, which was posted on Wednesday, praising the &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; recipients for their &#8220;kindness and compassion&#8221;.</p>



<p>William told them: &#8220;My mother&#8230; would be immensely proud of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Prince, in his letter on Kensington Palace headed notepaper, describes how the &#8220;world can feel an uncertain and unfamiliar place&#8221;.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/prince-harry/">Harry</a>, meanwhile, has recorded a video message which will be played during the virtual Diana Award ceremony today.</p>



<p>The Duke will speak of how Diana&#8217;s view of the world still inspires him as he outlines the challenges the world faces including &#8220;systemic injustices&#8221;.</p>



<p>He, like William, will reference the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/charity/">charity</a>&#8216;s mission of inspiring young people to make &#8220;positive change&#8221;.</p>

<p>READING and Leeds Festival fans are convinced they have worked out one of the headliners after spotting three clues.</p>



<p>The hotly-anticipated line-up is set to be revealed tonight and eagle-eyed rock followers think Bring Me The Horizon will top <span id="08be94c6-545f-4b94-96df-65aea0797d53" class="suggested-link">the bill</span>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32140169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32140169" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/l-r-jordan-fish-mat-733410402.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32140169" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32140169" class="wp-caption-text">Fans think Bring Me The Horizon will be playing at Reading and Leeds</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32140166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32140166" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/editorial-use-oliver-sykes-bring-450826596.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32140166" width="960" height="619" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32140166" class="wp-caption-text">The band will be playing in Europe over the summer</figcaption></figure>



<p>The band will be heading to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/europe/">Europe</a> <span id="764aba31-2b2c-4412-a481-7f1b696aad53" class="suggested-link">next</span> year to headline Rock am Ring and it was originally billed as a European exclusive.</p>



<p>But fans have spotted the wording on the website has now changed and reads &#8211;  &#8216;European mainland&#8217; exclusive instead, suggesting the UK could also be on the cards. </p>



<p>Others have noted that the band just so happen to be on the cover of rock magazine Kerrang this week as the line-up is announced.</p>



<p>And in another clue – the band have previously headlined the festival in 2022 and fans think they are due a return to the stage, considering they have no other UK dates planned next year.</p>



<p>Back in May the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sheffield/">Sheffield</a> band released their first new album in four years &#8211; POST HUMAN: NeX GEn.</p>



<p>The dystopian record was originally slated for release last August but was subjected to a lengthy delay.</p>



<p>The record was the band&#8217;s first since the departure of keyboardist and songwriter Jordan Fish earlier this year.</p>



<p>He is largely credited with being a key driver behind the band&#8217;s move from the underground to the mainstream after joining in 2012.</p>



<p>Against the odds, the once niche band have risen to the top of the music pile here in the UK.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Everton vs Liverpool preview</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s always a top fixture but there is plenty riding on this Everton vs Liverpool clash.</p>



<p>The Toffees arrive full of confidence after a tremendous 4-0 thumping win over Wolves in midweek.</p>



<p>Sean Dyche&#8217;s side were winless in five before that but it&#8217;s only two defeats from their last 10 games &#8211; at Southampton and Old Trafford.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re five clear of relegation at the moment but head into a horror run of fixtures against the top four; Liverpool (H), Arsenal (A), Chelsea (H) and Man City (A).</p>



<p>Top of the tree is Liverpool, who dropped two points in dying minutes at St James&#8217; Park in midweek.</p>



<p>Given they were trailing twice, a draw was probably a fair result but when Mo Salah scored to put them ahead with less than 10 minutes to go, they must&#8217;ve thought they were there.</p>



<p>Liverpool&#8217;s record at Goodison over the years isn&#8217;t great &#8211; just two wins there since 2012.</p>



<p>But Everton have only won ONCE in that time &#8211; last time out &#8211; with plenty draws between the teams.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Point each</h3>



<p>There are currently 21 points separating Everton in 15th and the leaders Liverpool.</p>



<p>But a remarkable 10 out of the last 13 derbies between the teams at Goodison have ended all square.</p>



<p>This game has a habit of ending 0-0 but Everton must be buoyed by their four goals in midweek and Liverpool shipping three.</p>

<p>Mr Streeting confidently began reeling off Labour’s top “foundations,” saying: “It’s economic security, border security&#8230;”</p>



<p>He then awkwardly stalled for a few seconds before finally blurting out &#8220;national security&#8221;.</p>



<p>The slip came after Sir Keir Starmer unveiled six new “milestones” to measure the five “missions” he set out in February 2023 – all supposedly anchored by three key foundations: economic stability, secure borders, and national security.<br><br>The milestones are meant to provide Labour’s <span id="172c8a9d-c7cd-43ef-9bb3-63aba667f4fd" class="suggested-link">driving</span> purpose, with civil servants ordered to prioritise them.</p>



<p>But the new &#8220;Plan for Change&#8221; has raised eyebrows, with critics accusing Labour of shifting the goalposts and watering down key manifesto pledges.<br><br>At a speech in Buckinghamshire&#8217;s Pinewood Studios, Sir Keir declared his government would put the UK on track to achieve &#8220;at least 95 per cent clean <span id="fb4085bd-bb33-46c4-8891-d24c108d2b25" class="suggested-link">power</span>&#8221; by 2030.<br><br>But this falls short of Labour’s election promise of a fully zero-carbon power system within the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Further doubts have also emerged over Labour’s promise to secure the highest sustained growth in the <span id="5171e501-7367-46a6-88ea-3ac780176f09" class="suggested-link">G7</span>. </p>



<p>Initially billed as a cornerstone of Sir Keir&#8217;s vision, the bold pledge has since been downgraded to a more modest &#8220;aim.&#8221;</p>



<p>But speaking to The Sun Political Editor Harry Cole, Chancellor <span id="3c385f8e-b725-4281-aaf5-59af77987817" class="suggested-link">Rachel Reeves</span> insisted Britain can outpace the US and lead the G7 in economic growth by the end of the decade.</p>



<p>Brushing off doubts, Ms Reeves said she’s “hugely optimistic” about Britain’s <span id="e88bad15-6c61-49c5-a606-97135f72ba27" class="suggested-link">future</span>, saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s a mission. That we set out two years ago. And those missions remain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What we want is for that growth to be felt by people in their pockets. Which is why the milestone we&#8217;ve set out today is that people&#8217;s incomes go up, that people feel better off, because in the end, the whole purpose of growing our economy is so that working people feel better off. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m determined to happen.&#8221;</p>



<p><span id="0d4c2b75-9744-474c-8fec-4332d3d51ea6" class="suggested-link">Energy</span> Secretary <span id="e4f05e6e-6365-461f-b153-54d1d194f325" class="suggested-link">Ed Miliband</span> also said about plans to decarbonise the grid: &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be watered down. And I think what&#8217;s so interesting about it is when we first launched it a couple of years ago, people said it was unachievable. </p>

<p>&#8220;Now when you talk to industry, when you look at the judgment of the independent national energy system operator, they say it&#8217;s really hard, but it is achievable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Responding to the speech, Tory leader <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/kemi-badenoch/">Kemi Badenoch</a> said the Prime Minister’s “emergency reset” showed Labour had not been “ready for government”.</p>



<p>She also claimed the Government’s “costly plans for energy decarbonisation” had been “watered-down”, and “fewer than a third of Labour’s 13,000 neighbourhood <span id="40f24857-ffa1-4dcd-b9d8-7352fd3d48e3" class="suggested-link">police</span> are actually new police officers”.</p>



<p>Ms Badenoch added: “This relaunch can’t hide the reality of a Government that doesn’t know what it is doing.”</p>



<p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ed-davey/">Ed Davey</a> said the Prime Minister was “simply moving the goalposts” and described the lack of a <span id="6af2b1a6-d10a-4562-88fa-d1f8c09a64e5" class="suggested-link">target</span> for <span id="9d008e1a-ed21-4ec4-82de-4f8d84c77f92" class="suggested-link">GP</span> appointments as “worrying”, while <span id="ac9f59b3-dd35-401e-a543-00a157eacc62" class="suggested-link">Reform UK</span> leader <span id="727af278-93d0-4af0-8b0f-7d2902b6c753" class="suggested-link">Nigel Farage</span> criticised the lack of a target on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/immigration/">immigration</a>.</p>

<p><strong>By <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/author/ryan-sabey/">Ryan Sabey</a>, Deputy Political Editor</strong></p>
<p>The British people will be forgiven for not being on top of where this government is heading.</p>
<p>Please, keep up.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now got six milestones, to add to five missions, six first steps and that is on top of three foundations.</p>
<p>But the Prime Minister headed to the glitzy Pinewood studios to unveil milestones on which he wants to be judged.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s raising living standards, more bobbies on the beat and reducing NHS waiting times &#8211; the PM is going all out for change.</p>
<p>But many people will say this is just a Mission: Impossible.</p>
<p>The PM is right when he says the new milestones that he set out will allow the public to &#8220;hold our feet to the fire&#8221; saying it will be for the long-term good of the country.</p>
<p>He also wants a major snake-up of Whitehall declaring that civil servants &#8220;are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline&#8221;.</p>
<p>One new promise included 150 new major infrastructure projects this Parliament as he hits out at the NIMBYs holding up projects.</p>
<p>But there was one gaping hole in the plan &#8211; there was no mention in migration in the six promises to judge him by.</p>
<p>Sir Keir says he has to &#8220;get to grips&#8221; with the problem of illegal migration and small boat crossings &#8211; but the public will want to see a measure that is more concrete.</p>

<p>THIS year&#8217;s Spotify Wrapped event has left listeners feeling hard done by, with users confused over a &#8220;lazy&#8221; theme and missing features.</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2016, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/spotify" target="_blank" aria-label="Spotify  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify </a>Wrapped has become an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/" target="_blank" aria-label="internet  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet </a>sensation, with users plastering screenshots of their roundups on their <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="social media (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> pages like badges of honour. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32138898" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138898" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024SpotifyWrappedAIPodcast.png?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138898" width="960" height="496" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138898" class="wp-caption-text">The only AI used in Spotify Wrapped appears to be the AI DJ, AI Playlist and AI Podcast feature, which accompanies your usual Spotify Wrapped</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millions tune into the annual event. </p>



<p>But many have been left outraged by a lack of top genres and fun trivia about their favorite songs or artists in their Wrapped. </p>



<p>Folks are also confused why it did not have a section for top podcasts.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was sooo underwhelming this year,&#8221; one user wrote on X (formerly <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>). &#8220;Ugh no genres, no top albums.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This year&#8217;s Spotify Wrapped felt so rushed and lazy,&#8221; said a second user.</p>



<p>Another added that it &#8220;makes me wanna move over to Apple Music&#8230; is it really that good over there?&#8221;</p>



<p>A fourth person replied, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about it too… apparently the audio quality is better.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Wrapped] feels so lifeless and dull this year, plus it didn’t show our top genres.&#8221;</p>



<p><a aria-label="Apple  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/apple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple </a>Music is largely considered Spotify&#8217;s top rival &#8211; and has come up with its Wrapped-inspired Replay which shows your music stats from the past year. </p>



<p>While Apple doesn&#8217;t cough up any trivia, it does break down your top genres, your top artists by month, top songs by month and more.</p>

<p>One rumour circulating online suggests Spotify&#8217;s layoffs last year have directly impacted the Wrapped experience this year.</p>



<p>People are saying that Spotify replaced much of its Wrapped team with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" aria-label="artificial intelligence (AI). (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence (AI).</a></p>



<p>However, there is no evidence of this.</p>



<p>The only AI used in Spotify Wrapped appears to be the AI DJ, AI Playlist and AI Podcast feature, which accompanies your usual Spotify Wrapped.</p>



<p>Although, the gobbledygook &#8216;genres&#8217; Spotify offered users has not helped the allegations, according to several tweets from listeners.</p>



<p>Users were given a seemingly random assortment of words in place of genres, such as &#8220;grandmother old school soul motown&#8221;, &#8220;pumpkin spice rollerskating pop&#8221;, &#8220;mallgoth rock out metalcore&#8221; and &#8220;pink pilates princess strut pop&#8221;.</p>



<p>Spotify has adopted what appears to be &#8216;internet speak&#8217; to convey its genres this year, which can only be understood by the chronically online. </p>



<p>&#8220;Spotify Wrapped has lost what made it so dynamic in the first place,&#8221; another user added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The city mapping and zodiac sign integration etc made it fun and immersive.&#8221;</p>



<p>While a sixth listener tweeted: &#8220;Wrapped was such a BUST compared to years prior.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve saved screenshots of all my wraps and this one was by far the most unoriginal and bland use of my data.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last night the celebrities took part in Arcade of Agony, which ended up being won by Maura, Danny Jones, Oti Mabuse and Coleen Rooney.</p>



<p>But while Maura was doing the challenge she kept screaming &#8211; which didn&#8217;t go unnoticed by the viewers. </p>



<p>Many took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to say the same thing. </p>



<p>One wrote on the platform: &#8220;Maura is one of those celebrities with a shelf life on this show. Started off entertaining to watch and now there’s nothing left but irritating screaming #ImACeleb.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another added: &#8220;I reckon Maura is that woman who’s always screaming in the background whenever you watch a punch up video on Twitter/X… #ImACeleb #imacelebrity2024.&#8221;</p>



<p>A third chimed in: &#8220;Maura stop the screaming and get on with it. #ImACeleb.&#8221;</p>



<p>However others took to the social media platform to share how much they love her. </p>



<p>A fourth said: &#8220;ALL Maura’s fans need to start VOTINGto SAVE MAURA from hereon in! Just imagine the show without her!</p>



<p>A fifth tweeted: &#8220;Maura was a boss at the ticket trial.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Need Maura to win the challenge she has to do cyclone would be TV gold,&#8221; another chimed in.</p>

<p>Last night Maura fumed as<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32119894/maura-higgins-fumes-alan-halsall-swipe-im-a-celebrity/" rel=""> Alan took a brutal swipe </a>at her voice after a boozy I&#8217;m A Celeb party.</p>



<p>The camp mates let their hair down at the Jungle Arms and enjoyed some karaoke. </p>



<p>Maura decided to belt out Celine Dion&#8217;s It&#8217;s All Coming Back To Me. </p>



<p>But Alan and Barry McGuigan mocked her vocals. </p>

<p>THIS private island with its own golf course has just gone up for sale for an eye-watering £62.5million</p>



<p>Kaibu Island is part of Fiji’s Lau collection of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>For the huge sum of money, the buyer would get an 800-acre resort, three villas, an airstrip, an aircraft &#8211; and even a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/golf/">golf</a> course.</p>



<p>And now Vladi Private Islands has put it up sale &#8220;in time for Christmas&#8221;.</p>



<p>It would certainly beat stripy socks.</p>



<p>The desert island estate agent sells and rents out hundreds of islands, but this one is being marketed as this season’s “Ultimate Package”.</p>



<p>The island is covered in lush green vegetation with pristine white-sand beaches around the perimeter.</p>



<p>Crystal-clean, shimmering blue waters make the perfect spot for a quick dip after soaking up some Fijian rays.</p>



<p>It is also the only private island in the world to come with its own submarine, provided by U-Boat Worx. </p>



<p>The land-based operations run on solar <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/power-2/">power</a> and “follow organic standards”, so you can live in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/luxury/">luxury</a> and be sustainable at the same time.</p>



<p>And if you manage to get a car out there, six miles of &#8220;compacted aggregate roads&#8221; await for you to cruise.</p>



<p>Farhad Vladi, CEO of Vladi Private Islands, said: &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/">Christmas</a> is just around the corner and the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/race/">race</a> to buy the perfect present is well and truly on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROBBIE Williams has been ordered to pop down to his local garden centre and splash out on a tulip tree for the garden of his London mansion after winning a planning fight. </p>



<p>He&#8217;s been given permission to chop down yet another tree at the lavish property after telling his local council it was diseased.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32138687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138687" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/robbie-williams-attends-better-man-954579312.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138687" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138687" class="wp-caption-text">ROBBIE Williams has been ordered to pop down to his local garden centre and splash out on a tulip tree for the garden of his London mansion</figcaption></figure>

<p>And that was despite opposition from a concerned local resident.</p>



<p>Now <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/robbie-williams/">Robbie&#8217;s</a> won the battle to wield the axe, but chiefs in his borough have told him: &#8220;The Borough stipulates that in this case a tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), or an alternative agreed species, of 20-25cm girth a shall be planted as a replacement. </p>



<p>&#8220;If the tree(s) is removed outside the planting season the new tree shall be planted in the next planting season following removal (the planting season runs from 1 November to 31 March).</p>



<p>&#8220;If it is removed during the planting season the new tree shall be planted in the same planting season. </p>



<p>&#8220;If, within five years of the date of planting, the replacement tree/s dies, is removed or becomes seriously dangerous or diseased, it shall be replaced in the next planting season with another tree/s of the same size and species.&#8221;</p>



<p>Robbie&#8217;s application said: &#8220;Norway Maple &#8211; remove due extensive decay at the base (Honey fungus). Replant with species tbc.&#8221;</p>



<p>But one person said in a letter of objection to the council: &#8221; There is no explanation as to why this tree need be felled, only a series of photos showing parts of it are damaged.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should there not be a written report that accompanies each proposed felling and what courses of action could be done before the final resort of felling this tree?&#8221;</p>



<p>He’s chopped down a string of trees at his pad in recent years.</p>

<p>One angry person said of a previous application: “Hello, I wish to object very strongly to this application.</p>



<p>“Mr Williams has already been granted permission to chop down several trees at his property and now another seems likely to fall victim to his wishes.</p>



<p>“How many more does he wish to eradicate from his property? Trees are our friends and not our enemies. We must love them &#8211; and not to take an axe to them.”</p>



<p>It comes after Robbie<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/27942509/robbie-williams-california-mansion/"> sold his impressive LA property earlier this year. </a></p>

<p>IT&#8217;S the end of an era for former Premier League winner, Oscar.</p>



<p>The ex-Chelsea star <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32116479/premier-league-china-oscar/">bid farewell to the Chinese Super League</a>, with his contract expiring at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Oscar joined Shanghai Port in 2017 for £60m and went on to win three league titles in the Far East.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/25184628/chelsea-oscar-china-super-league-earnings/">he earned £175million during his time</a> in East Asia &#8211; making him one of the richest footballers of all time.</p>



<p>The playmaker was left in tears as he waved goodbye to the fans in his last game on Tuesday.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s leaving behind a life that will be sorely missed.</p>



<p>Back in September, he told <a href="https://www.brasil247.com/english/oscar-is-set-to-leave-china-and-laments-the-quality-of-life-here-doesnt-exist-anywhere-else-ive-never-seen-it" rel="nofollow">Brazil 247</a>: &#8220;The quality of life here doesn&#8217;t exist anywhere else, I&#8217;ve never seen it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something out of this world, only those who are here, who live here, know what it&#8217;s like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He, his wife Brazilian/Japanese wife Ludy and their three kids, Julia and Caio clearly loved being in the country&#8217;s biggest city.</p>



<p>But his reasons for going back are tied to family.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love Shanghai, but it&#8217;s just too far away from home for us. We can&#8217;t stay here forever,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;My mom is getting older, my sisters are having babies. We want to be closer to home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wherever I go, it won&#8217;t be like here. There&#8217;s no way to change that,&#8221;</p>



<p>The family live in a plush apartment that overlooks the scenic Huangpu River.</p>



<p>Oscar has given his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/">Instagram</a> followers, over six million, a glimpse into his home.</p>



<p>It boasts incredible views of the skyline of<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/shanghai/"> Shanghai,</a> which comes alive at night with its lights.</p>



<p>High ceilings, neutral interiors, marble floors and more are featured.</p>



<p>The building also appears to have a private gym that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/26603346/chelsea-oscar-transfer-return-european-football/">Oscar </a>used religiously.</p>

<p>Oscar said: &#8220;My kids go to school and come back home by bus without worrying about safety. We can go out as much as we want at 2 am or 3 am, and go anywhere and nothing will happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oscar and his wife have been known to take in the nightlife, enjoying cocktails and hanging out at the five-star hotel,  Peninsula Shanghai.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life centres around the river</h2>



<p>Although his life has been dedicated to playing for Shanghai Port, with countless pictures of his success, Huangpu River plays a massive part in his downtime.</p>



<p>When he&#8217;s not playing with Lego &#8211; he enjoying showing off making <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31828528/barcelona-blocked-stadium-return-nou-camp-postponed/">the Camp Nou</a> in one Instagram snap &#8211; he&#8217;s enjoying activities on the landmark of the city.</p>



<p>The Huangpu River separates the city into two parts, Pudong and Pux.</p>



<p>Plenty of the locals, as well as tourists, enjoy boat trips or other activities there.</p>



<p>Oscar has taken his family on excursions, shared loving moments with wife Ludy, and canoeing with his son.</p>



<p>Only a few months ago, Oscar admitted he didn&#8217;t know where he would go.</p>

<p>MIKE TYSON had his family worried about the Jake Paul fight but left them proud of his performance.</p>



<p>The 58-year-old grandfather and boxing legend faced the 27-year-old YouTuber in a criminally sanctioned fight in Texas on November 15 &#8211; just five months after suffering a burst ulcer.</p>

<p>After the fight, he revealed he had needed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31768167/mike-tyson-jake-paul-boxing-netflix/" rel="">eight blood transfusions and almost died</a>.</p>



<p>But still Paul could not put a single dent in him and the bout went the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31754912/jake-paul-mike-tyson-fight-boo/" rel="">full and dull eight rounds</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/" rel="">SunSport</a> at the IBA Champions Night launch, Iron Mike&#8217;s son Amir told us: “I was very proud but yes of course I was worried.</p>



<p>“I knew he wasn’t going to get knocked down or out, because he can take those punches.</p>



<p>“But, at the same, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jake-paul/" rel="">Jake</a> is younger, faster and bigger &#8211; when you get older your cardio diminishes.</p>



<p>“But he did it better than any 58-year-old, he went the distance and I am proud as hell of what he did. It was like a Rocky XI moment.</p>



<p>“Most athletes finish and retire into the sunset, but for him to remain this relevant, for so many generations, it shows you everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am very proud.”</p>

<p>After the bout &#8211; with most boxing fans hoping Tyson and Paul would both instantly retire &#8211; Iron Mike offered to face brother and fellow celebrity fighter <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/logan-paul/" rel="">Logan Paul</a>.</p>



<p>And caring <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31589145/mike-tyson-son-amir-who/" rel="">Amir</a> revealed even if he begged his beloved father to hang up the gloves.</p>

<p>But the former heavyweight champ is too stubborn to ever listen.</p>



<p>Amir laughed: “That chat would be a waste of time! He is his own man.</p>



<p>“If I say too much he’d only tell me to shut up and remind me I’m not his dad.</p>



<p>“I can say my part but he is the grown-up and he will do whatever he wants.</p>



<p>“I’ll chip in and say ‘that was a great LAST fight, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31558903/mike-tyson-children-boxing-jake-paul/" rel="">leave it at that</a>’.</p>



<p>“But if he wants to do it then nobody is going to stop him, because he loves it.”</p>



<p>Amir, 27, is a US sports broadcaster and worked on the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/netflix/" rel="">Netflix</a> show.</p>



<p>Moments before the fight, he entered his dad’s dressing room for a final chat and &#8211; in a genuinely touching moment &#8211; he told his dad that he loved him.</p>



<p>But the dedicated cameraman focused on Tyson walking away, accidentally <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31754697/mike-tyson-wardrobe-malfunction-stunned-netflix-viewers/" rel="">revealing his bare bottom</a> in a clip that went viral.</p>



<p>He explained: “Everyone has been asking me if it was intentional or scripted but of course it wasn’t.</p>



<p>“We went into the room to interview, I told him I loved him and then the cameraman followed his walk off.</p>



<p>“That s*** was crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>IT&#8217;S said there are plenty more fish in the sea after a breakup and for some celebrities, they like to find an identical one to their ex.</strong></p>

<p>The Northern Irish actor seems to be following the well-established tradition of never staying too far from your romantic type &#8211;  just like his fellow celebrities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have a look at the stars who could be forgiven for calling their partner a name of their ex because they look so similar&#8230;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kanye&nbsp;West</h2>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kanye-west/" rel="">Kanye West</a>, 47, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-kardashian/" rel="">Kim Kardashian</a>, 44, finally split, it appeared he decided his best course of action was a lookalike.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="attachment_32135602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32135602" style="width: 676px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/notes-fashion-metropolitan-museum-art-838730288.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=676" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32135602" width="676" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32135602" class="wp-caption-text">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were married</figcaption></figure>



<p>He&#8217;s currently wed to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/australia/">Australia</a> designer <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bianca-censori/" rel="">Bianca Censori</a>, 29, who shares a lot of features with his ex-wife.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32130554" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130554" style="width: 721px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/kanye-west-bianca-censori-attends-949434616_a92dba.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=721" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130554" width="721" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130554" class="wp-caption-text">Kanye seems unbothered by his wife&#8217;s barely there style choices</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like reality star Kim, she has a huge bottom, an ample cleavage and even favours similar clothes and sunglasses.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32135640" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32135640" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/newspress-collage-1ppxc7ia8-1733412645008.jpg?1733412676&amp;strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32135640" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32135640" class="wp-caption-text">The two women look remarkably similar</figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, Bianca somehow manages to go out dressed in less than the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/" rel="">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gigi Hadid</h2>



<p>Given that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/gigi-hadid/" rel="">Gigi Hadid</a>, 29, is a supermodel, it&#8217;s no surprise that she likes her partners to be well groomed and fashion forward.</p>



<p>Baby daddy <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/zayn-malik/" rel="">Zayn Malik</a>, 31, looks incredibly like her other all-singing, all-dancing, boy band ex <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/joe-jonas/" rel="">Joe Jonas</a>, 35.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32126736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32126736" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2015-gigi-hadid-boyfriend-joe-954733299.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32126736" width="960" height="941" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32126736" class="wp-caption-text">You&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking Gigi was posing with the same man in these photos</figcaption></figure>



<p>Both hunks have dark hair, piercing eyes and know how to rock a suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigi dated Joe for less than a year. </p>



<p>She was with Zayn for around five years and the pair share daughter Khai, four.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re both also heavily tattooed &#8211; although the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/one-direction/" rel="">One Direction</a> star possibly has more inking over his body.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kate Moss</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kate-moss/">Kate Moss</a>, 50, is yet another model who likes to keep things consistent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her current partner <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/count-nikolai-von-bismarck/">Count Nikolai von Bismarck</a>, 37, looks an awful lot like her former partner Jefferson Hack, 53. </p>

<p>Both girls have moved between their natural dark hair and blonde highlights.</p>



<p>They also appear to love a bikini picture, dressing up and even working out in similar outfits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Simon Cowell&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Music mogul <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/simon-cowell/" rel="">Simon Cowell</a>, 65, might look for something different when screening talent, but he doesn&#8217;t apply that for romantic partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His fiancee <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/lauren-silverman/" rel="">Lauren Silverman</a> is the latest in a string of beautiful dark haired women to grace his arm, having been with her since 2013.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before that, he was engaged to American Idol makeup artist Mezghain Hussainy from 2010 to 2013.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32127724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32127724" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/uk-market-call-pricing-simon-954733894.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32127724" width="960" height="944" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32127724" class="wp-caption-text">Simon Cowell&#8217;s fiancee (right) looks a lot like his ex-girlfriend Mezghan Hussainy (left)</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also both look remarkably like Simon&#8217;s former long-term partner Terri Seymour, 51, who he dated for five years.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32136455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32136455" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/file-photo-dated-25-02-4265851.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=635" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32136455" width="635" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32136455" class="wp-caption-text">Simon also dated Terri Seymour</figcaption></figure>



<p>There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any bad blood between the exes as Terri and her husband spend a lot of time with Simon and Lauren.</p>



<p>They even have play dates for their respective children. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jennifer Aniston</h2>



<p>The Friends star, 55, certainly has a type when it comes to her men.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jennifer-aniston/">Jennifer Aniston</a> dated singer John Mayer, 47, for a year in the late 2000s and clearly fell for his dark hair and brown eyes.</p>

<p>So much so that she ended up dating lookalike <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/justin-theroux/" rel="">Justin Theroux</a>, 53, for eight years from 2010.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32130517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130517" style="width: 674px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2017-vanity-fair-oscar-party-954749748.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=674" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130517" width="674" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130517" class="wp-caption-text">Justin has a similar look to John down to bushy eyebrows and cropped, black hair</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Justin isn&#8217;t a crooner like her ex, he is still in the arts world as an actor. </p>

<p>Singer <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/18564036/marc-anthony-girlfriend-wife-dating-history/" rel="">Marc Anthony</a>, 56, clearly struggled to get over Jenny from the block after they split in 2011.</p>



<p>He and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jennifer-lopez/" rel="">Jennifer Lopez</a>, 55, divorced in 2014 after a decade of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/marriage-2/">marriage</a> and two children. </p>

<p>After their split, he turned to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/chloe-green/" rel="">Chloe Green</a>, 33, for comfort, and she happened to be a spitting image of his ex-wife. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gavin Rossdale</h2>



<p>Rocker <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/gavin-rossdale/" rel="">Gavin Rossdale</a>, 59, appears to have a type and that is to be blonde and look like his ex-wife <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/gwen-stefani/">Gwen Stefani</a>, 55.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32135954" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32135954" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/l-r-gwen-stefani-gavin-888640969.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32135954" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32135954" class="wp-caption-text">Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale were married</figcaption></figure>

<p>ITV has released a first look at an exciting new drama starring Martin Clunes. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/martin-clunes/" rel="">Martin</a> stars as a farmer confronted with dark forces sweeping into his rural community.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32137031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32137031" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/buffalo-pictures-reproduced-editorial-purposes-954768569.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32137031" width="960" height="639" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32137031" class="wp-caption-text">Martin Clunes stars as a farmer who tries to protect his teenage sons from drug gangs</figcaption></figure>

<p>County lines drug-dealing and an escalating and insidious <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/">crime</a> wave sweeping the British countryside are the subject of this thrilling new drama.</p>



<p>Martin plays Nathan while <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/17571206/louis-ashbourne-serkis-no-return-father/" rel="">Louis Ashbourne </a>Serkis takes the role of his 15-year-old son Johnny.</p>



<p>In the just released trailer, we see Nathan looking at his farm and telling his son Johnny that one day soon it will all be his.</p>



<p>Johnny replies sarcastically: &#8220;Great.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trailer then skips to a village scene where a young boy approaches Johnny and hands him a bag to look after for two days.</p>



<p>The boy is heard saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s just a bit of weed, Johnny. I&#8217;ll owe you&#8221; before he saunters off. </p>



<p>Johnny reluctantly takes it but later discovers that the bag has gone missing from his room.</p>



<p>He blames the house cleaner for stealing it and goes into a panic.</p>



<p>We then see a snippet of Martin receiving a phone call from his son who says: &#8220;Dad, I think I just killed someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>The gripping trailer continues with Nathan trying to protect his teenage son as he falls deeper into the crime world.</p>

<p>And a voice on the trailer is heard to say: &#8220;Sometimes in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/farming/">farming</a> you have to kill a healthy animal for the betterhood of the herd&#8221;</p>



<p>The trailer then ends with the question: &#8220;How far would you go to protect your own?&#8221;</p>



<p>The series follows Nathan who cherishes his farming land but his peaceful life is steadily threatened by the stealthy and covert invasion of drug dealers. </p>



<p>These urban <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gangs/">gangs</a> are using the British countryside as a field of operations in order to move <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/drugs/">drugs</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/money/">money</a> between their inner-city hubs and provincial areas.</p>

<p>MANY people dislike feet &#8211; some even have a fear of them. </p>



<p>But your feet could provide early clues to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/">health</a> problems in other parts of your body. </p>

<p>One symptom in your feet to be wary of could also be caused by cold <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/weather-2/">weather</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nhs/">NHS</a> doctor <span id="202972fa-09e7-4f51-8631-801e10c1c7a3" class="suggested-link">Amir Khan</span>, who&#8217;s a resident doctor on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/lorraine/">Lorraine</a>, issued a stark warning what having <span id="5dbc8c6a-b584-47fc-9a0d-1129642eb0b5" class="suggested-link">cold feet</span> could mean. </p>



<p>Addressing his half a million followers on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/instagram/">Instagram</a>, he said: &#8220;If you suffer from cold feet or toes and that&#8217;s unusual for you, that could be a sign of circulatory problems &#8211; a condition called peripheral vascular disease.</p>



<p>&#8220;This means there&#8217;s a problem with their very small blood vessels in your feet and it&#8217;s restricting the blood flow your feet. </p>



<p>&#8220;It can be a sign of poorly controlled <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/diabetes/">diabetes</a>, high <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/5468531/high-cholesterol-causes-level-lower/" target="_blank" aria-label="cholesterol (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, and is more common if you <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/smoking/" target="_blank" aria-label="smoke (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoke</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many people with PAD have no symptoms, but the first sign many people develop is a painful ache in their legs when they walk. </p>



<p>This pain usually disappears after a few minutes&#8217; rest. </p>



<p>Both legs are often affected at the same time, but the pain can be worse in one leg. </p>



<p>According to the NHS, there are eight other symptoms of PAD:</p>



<ul>
<li>hair loss on your legs and feet</li>



<li>numbness or weakness in the legs</li>



<li>brittle, slow-growing toenails</li>



<li>ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs, which do not heal</li>



<li>changing skin colour on your legs, such as turning paler than usual or blue – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin</li>



<li>shiny skin</li>



<li>in men, erectile dysfunction </li>



<li>the muscles in your legs shrinking (wasting)</li>
</ul>

<p>Symptoms usually develop slowly over time &#8211; if they develop quickly or suddenly it could be a sign of something more serious and require immediate medical attention. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s no cure for PAD, but lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce symptoms. </p>



<p>If it&#8217;s left untreated, it can lead to serious complications, such as gangrene, heart attack and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/stroke/">stroke</a>, and amputation. </p>

<p>If you experience recurring leg pain when exercising you should see a GP. </p>
<p>Many people mistake this pain as a part of growing older, but a healthy person shouldn&#8217;t experience leg pain. </p>
<p>PAD is usually diagnosed through a physical examination by a GP, and by&nbsp;comparing the&nbsp;blood pressure in your arm and your ankle.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a difference between the two, this may indicate PAD. This is known as the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Other signs in your feet to look out for&#8230; </h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Burning or tingling pain</strong></h2>



<p>Dr Amir shared some other concerning signs that can appear in your feet, one of which is burning or tingling pain.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gp/">GP</a>, this could be a sign of a problem with your nerves, a condition called peripheral neuropathy. </p>



<p>He explained: &#8220;It&#8217;s more common if you have poorly controlled diabetes, but also you can get it if you have low B12 or folic acid level, if you have thyroid disease, if you drink a lot of alcohol and certain medications can do it as well.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pain in the bottom of your foot</h2>



<p>If you have pain in the bottom of your foot when you try and walk and can&#8217;t remember injuring it, it could be a condition called plantar fasciitis. </p>



<p>Dr Amir said: &#8220;That&#8217;s inflammation of the tissue underneath your foot and it normally gives you a sharp stabbing pain usually in your heel. </p>



<p>&#8220;It can feel a bit like a stone in your shoe.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sore or ulcer that won&#8217;t heal</h2>



<p>One sign that&#8217;s really important to remember is if you have a sore or ulcer on your foot that won&#8217;t heal. </p>



<p>Always get this checked, urged Dr Amir. He added: &#8220;Some skin cancers can present with a sore that doesn&#8217;t heal. </p>



<p>&#8220;But remember, wounds need good food and oxygen and a good blood flow to heal well. </p>



<p>&#8220;If you have poor circulation, diabetes that isn&#8217;t well controlled, all of these can negatively affect those things and prolong the healing process as well as increasing your risk of infection.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Swollen feet</h2>



<p>Finally, Dr Amir warned about having swollen feet, a &#8220;super common&#8221; symptom. </p>



<p>He said: &#8220;This can happen if you spend lots of time on your feet through the day and it&#8217;s much more common in the <span id="93d8ae5b-8dfa-4b6a-b8da-fea7b665cd8b" class="suggested-link">summer</span> months. </p>



<p>&#8220;Usually it&#8217;s nothing to worry about and all you have to do is elevate your feet when you get home. </p>



<p>&#8220;But you can get swollen feet if you have problems with your liver, your kidneys, or even your heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can have swollen feet if you&#8217;re overweight or pregnant or taking certain medication. </p>



<p>&#8220;You can get swollen feet in arthritis, infections and sometimes even with a blood clot even especially if it&#8217;s on sided.&#8221;</p>



<p>If any symptoms with your feet are unexplained, always get them checked out by your GP.</p>

<p><strong>PETE Tong has found the next big dance music talent with the winner of his remix competition. </strong></p>



<p>German DJ and producer FR3ADY real name — Frederic Rappenecker — pipped over 1,000 hopefuls to the accolade <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/music/31000409/pete-tong-release-me/" rel="">with his remix of Pete’s new track, Release Me.</a></p>



<figure id="attachment_32139054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32139054" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NINTCHDBPICT000954789095.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32139054" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32139054" class="wp-caption-text">Pete Tong found FR3ADY (right) through a competition</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s a collaboration with Paul Harris, The Essential Orchestra’s Jules Buckley and has Poppy Baskomb on vocals.</p>



<p>FR3ADY’s fabulous remix is out now on Ministry Of Sound Recordings. And next week he will take to the stage alongside Pete at London’s O2 to open his Ibiza Classics show.</p>



<p>Frederic, 26, says it’s a dream come true &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/cYFkU6aPSso?si=BI5U5tl4GE-s4HIe" target="_blank" aria-label="with his winning track here. (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">with his winning track here.</a></p>



<p>He told us:&nbsp;“I’m feeling a mix of excitement and nerves — it’s a huge moment for me to play in front of 16,000 people. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve always dreamed of performing at an arena like this, and it’s surreal to see it coming true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I remember attending big festivals and events, thinking, ‘One day, I’ll be up there’. I can&#8217;t wait to share some of my unreleased tracks and take the audience on a musical journey full of surprises. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s going to be a special night!”</p>



<p>FR3ADY has already tasted success since completing a degree in Music Production and Sound Engineering from the Abbey Road Institute. After making Amsterdam his home, he’s gained notoriety with his Rooftop Tapes events.</p>



<p>But it’s Pete and his DJ Academy that have played the biggest role in his career so far, after he won the institution’s Future Talent Award and playing at the closing party for Pete’s International Music Summit in Ibiza at Club Chinois earlier this year. Winning Pete’s remix competition is the icing on cake. FR3DAY says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t be where I am today without Pete’s DJ Academy. The support from the entire team has been invaluable, and I’m so grateful to have met them when I won the Future Talent Award. The music industry can be tough, and having the right people who believe in you can make all the difference. I’ve seen significant growth thanks to their guidance, and I’m excited to see what the future holds. 2025 is just around the corner, and this is only the beginning!”</p>



<p>As we look forward to what FR3ADY has in store next week at the O2, we caught up with him this week and asked him to give us a taste of what we can expect from him with an exclusive mix he’s recorded for The Night Bazaar Sessions on Mxcloud.</p>

<p>THE REVAMPED Fifa Club World Cup increases to 32 teams in 2025 with Manchester City and Chelsea among those in action. </p>



<p>It will now be contested with a similar format to the World Cup,<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32109229/fifa-club-world-cup-2025-dazn/" rel=""> staged next year in America from June 15-July 13.</a></p>

<figure id="attachment_32138770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138770" style="width: 851px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/club-league-logos-live-services-954567195.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=851" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138770" width="851" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138770" class="wp-caption-text">Cole Palmer&#8217;s Chelsea face a horror draw</figcaption></figure>



<p>Teams will be divided into eight groups of four and play each other once, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the knockout stage.</p>



<p>The last 16 is the first single knockout round &#8211; followed by the quarter-final, semi-final and then final.</p>



<p>But it all kicks off with the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32124755/club-world-cup-draw-live-stream-free-updates/">group-stage draw</a>, staged in Miami, where the likes of Real Madrid and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1249869/bayern-munich/">Bayern Munich</a> find out their fate.</p>



<p>Certain teams cannot draw each other, for example sides from the same league such as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196660/chelsea/">Chelsea</a> and City or Flamengo and Fluminense.</p>



<p>Fifa split the top seeding pot by handing four slots to Europe and four to South America, based on their continental coefficient ranking.</p>



<p>So City, Madrid, Bayern and PSG are joined by Brazilians Flamengo, Palmeiras and Fluminense and Argentina’s River Plate.</p>



<p>The other eight European sides, including Chelsea, are in pot two.</p>



<p>Pot three is made up of the remaining South American teams &#8211; Boca Juniors and Botafogo &#8211; and the two highest ranked sides from the other three major confederations.</p>



<p>Pot four will see the remaining sides, although Inter Miami are already confirmed as playing in Group A and Seattle Sounders will play all their games at home.</p>



<p>SunSport simulated the draw and it would be exciting news for City fans but not so much for Chelsea. </p>

<p>The Premier League champions drew Inter Milan, Botafogo and Inter Miami &#8211; meaning they would come up against Lionel Messi. </p>

<p>WHATSAPP users have spotted a second big change to the app days after the long-running &#8216;typing&#8230;&#8217; message was controversially scrapped.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/meta/" rel="">Meta</a>-owned platform now appears to have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/31961805/whatsapp-typing-new-icon-axed-replaced/" rel="">axed the message</a> at the top of the screen indicating that someone is recording a voice note.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32138233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138233" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/7a6477bc-5208-4e99-b8d4-8415aad8d38e_e81592.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138233" width="960" height="566" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138233" class="wp-caption-text">A microphone now appears when someone is recording a voice note</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32138269" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138269" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image001-4.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138269" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138269" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp confirmed a new typing indicator is here to stay</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead, it&#8217;s been replaced by a microphone icon that appears at the bottom of the screen.</p>



<p>More users have reported seeing the subtle change this week, though others have seen it before.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/whatsapp/" rel="">WhatsApp</a> is testing this feature for a select number of users or making it available widely.</p>



<p>But the shake-up is sure to annoy some, given the outrage over &#8216;typing&#8230;&#8217; being replaced.</p>



<p>It too no longer appears as text at the top of the screen and is replaced by a speech bubble with three dots at the bottom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not a fan of the new typing indicator on WhatsApp,&#8221; one user wrote on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/">X</a> at the time.</p>



<p>&#8220;WhatsApp now has the three dots typing thing like iMessage and I Hateeeee it,&#8221; another said.</p>



<p>The design overhaul has been compared to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/apple/">Apple</a>&#8216;s rival Messages app.</p>



<p>WhatsApp confirmed today that the new typing indicator is permanent and rolling out.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time WhatsApp has made subtle tweaks that led to a backlash.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the social network was slammed for simply capitalising &#8220;Online&#8221; and &#8220;Typing&#8230;&#8221;.</p>



<p>So much so, the social network u-turned and said it was only &#8220;a small test&#8221;.</p>

<p>TIRED of spending big on laser hair removal at the salon? Here&#8217;s a solution: a home IPL device.</p>



<p>We have an exclusive promo that lets you save big on an IPL device from a brand-new beauty brand.</p>

<p>Simply enter <strong>THESUN30</strong> at the checkout, and the price drops to £209.30 &#8211; that&#8217;s a saving of nearly £100.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.linkby.com/XGHBPPNL" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Keskine</a> is a new beauty brand to have on your radar, especially if you are shopping IPL hair removal devices.</p>



<p>IPL, which stands for Intense Pulsed Light, is not to be confused with in-salon laser hair removal.</p>



<p>IPL devices are safe for home use because they use broad spectrum light energy.</p>



<p>This covers a wider surface area on the skin and is typically gentler than the concentrated blasts of light you&#8217;ll receive with professional treatment.</p>



<p>This compact device boasts five programmed modes &#8211; face, body, bikini, underarm, and beauty &#8211; which make it super-easy to use.</p>



<p>Keskine&#8217;s handy tool also features an automatic mode, which means users don&#8217;t have to manually press the button to activate the light.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also fitted with Ice-Cooling technology, which helps keep the discomfort to a minimum.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s super-simple to operate: plug the chord into the main device, and the other to a mains, select your setting, and go.</p>



<p>It is important to mention IPL is best suited for specific skin and hair types. </p>



<p>As a general rule of thumb, the stronger the contrast between hair and skin tones, the more effective the treatment will be in reducing hair growth.</p>



<p>Keskine has claimed customers will notice a difference in their hair growth in just four weeks, but also offers 90-day money-back guarantee.</p>



<p>Reviews across the <a href="https://go.linkby.com/XGHBPPNL" target="_blank" aria-label="Keskine website (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Keskine website</a> have been glowing.</p>



<p>One happy shopper wrote: &#8220;[I] love my smooth skin. This has been a game-changer for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve struggled with shaving and waxing for years, but this hair removal device has made everything so much easier.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s easy to use and the results are impressive after just a few sessions.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another added: &#8220;I’ve been using this for a few weeks now, and the results are fantastic.</p>



<p>&#8220;My hair is growing back slower, and the device is so easy to handle and use.&#8221;</p>



<p>A separate shopper commented: &#8220;I’ve tried several products, and this one is by far the best.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s easy to use and works really well. I’m already seeing a noticeable reduction in hair growth.&#8221;</p>

<p>THIS week, the residents of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> learnt the sad news that fan favourite Les Battersby had passed away, seemingly in a work place accident.</p>



<figure id="attachment_31894828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31894828" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/d9e5cb41-9d68-4d49-9f90-a39b0e7aeb43.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-31894828" width="960" height="633" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31894828" class="wp-caption-text">Corrie fans are convinced they know who killed Les</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_31973781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31973781" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/itv-com-photographer-danielle-baguley-947017389_51621f.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-31973781" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31973781" class="wp-caption-text">Chesney is being stalked by a mysterious van</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as Les&#8217;s family gathered to hear a hilarious, yet moving, will reading at Adam Barlow’s office, fans were already connecting the death to recent events on the cobbles.</p>



<p>Les’s death had already raised suspicions when his family were offered £50,000 by his former employer if the family accepted the death as an accident and signed an NDA.</p>



<p>Whilst there were raised eyebrows amongst the Battersby clan it was Les’s Stepson Chesney who most vocally challenged the <span id="3b37930b-908e-4a71-8bd0-004d6a467f3a" class="suggested-link">news</span>.</p>



<p>With the abattoir unwilling to give the family any more information about exactly how Les died, the family were more suspicious than excited at the prospect of a payout.</p>



<p>Chesney was convinced that if the abattoir was offering that kind of <span id="7c93fe7c-34c7-4491-bb87-a08a3dbd26d0" class="suggested-link">money</span> out of hand then there must be something far more dodgy afoot.</p>



<p>Even his mother-in-law, Bernie, could see past the money to the mystery behind it.</p>



<p>For Chesney his week went from bad to worse as it seems the attentions he attracted of a strange stalker in a van has followed him back to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> after an earlier carpark altercation.</p>



<p>As the suspicious van’s activity intensified and Chesney spotted it sitting outside his home at number five, fans took to socials to draw a connection between the recent big events in Chesney’s life.</p>



<p>One viewer posed the question: “&#8221;So is the mystery man in the van who has been hassling Chesney connected to Les being killed at work?&#8221;</p>



<p>Other fans agreed saying: “Maybe ‘Van Man’ Killed Les.” And “&#8221;Right so now that van could be some butcher b******s trying to intimidate Les&#8217; nearest and dearest.&#8221;</p>



<p>Some even thought the mystery van driver could be Chesney’s own mum: “All this mention of Cilla makes me think she’s either the van man or she has something to do with Les’s dodgy will.”</p>



<p>It seems that fans are convinced that whoever is behind the wheel of the mysterious van they think they had a hand in Les’s death.</p>

<p>THERE&#8217;S barely time for Dream Team managers to catch their breath with Gameweek 14 fast approaching.</p>



<p>The Champions League, Europa League and Conference League are all set to resume in the week after a full round of Premier League fixtures which means the seven teams active in Europe are set to pull double duty.</p>



<p>We refuse to patronise you by listing obvious names such as Mohamed Salah (£7.4m), Bukayo Saka (£6.6m) and Erling Haaland (£8.6m) as transfer recommendations (because of course they are) but allow us to present some other suggestions ahead of Saturday&#8217;s 11am deadline. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32137153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32137153" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GM_05-12_DREAM-TEAM_COMP_791549.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32137153" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32137153" class="wp-caption-text">Confirm your transfers before Saturday&#8217;s 11am deadline</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Joe Gomez (£3.1m)</strong></p>



<p>Liverpool may have shipped three goals to Newcastle on Wednesday night but their defence has generally been a reliable source of points this season.</p>



<p>Ibrahima Konate (£4.8m) is expected to be sidelined until the new year and so Gomez is likely to get plenty of minutes &#8211; he started against Manchester City and the Magpies for a return of nine points in Gameweek 13.</p>



<p>The Reds have a much more favourable double header in Gameweek 14 in the form of Everton and Girona.</p>



<p>The Toffees will be motivated to hinder their neighbours&#8217; title charge but they are among the lowest scorers in the top flight while the Spanish outfit have not quite rekindled the magic of 2023/24 &#8211; they&#8217;re eighth in La Liga at present.</p>



<p>Arne Slot will be hopeful of at least one clean sheet in the coming days and Gomez could provide a cheap route to the points on offer.</p>



<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold (£5.7m) is anything but cheap as the most expensive defender in the game but he averages a mighty 6.9 points-per-game in 2024/25 and is therefore well set for a double-digit haul in Gameweek 14.</p>



<p>The creative right-back banked 16 points across his outings against Man City and Newcastle via two assists to remind Dream Team bosses of his pedigree upon return from injury.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32092053" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32092053" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/martin-odegaard-bukayo-saka-celebrate-951655989_d39c49.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32092053" width="960" height="698" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32092053" class="wp-caption-text">A formidable combination</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Martin Odegaard (£5.2m)</strong></p>



<p>The aforementioned Saka is Dream Team&#8217;s most in-form player at the time of writing and should probably be considered a must-have asset.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it might be worth doubling up on Arsenal midfielders for the festive period as their fixtures appear rather favourable.</p>



<p>The Gunners&#8217; captain has produced three assists and a goal in the space of three Gameweeks since his return to the starting line-up.</p>



<p>Odegaard&#8217;s numbers are impressive but, crucially, he&#8217;s also passed the eye test with flying colours since the end of the November international break.</p>



<p>Arsenal mustered one goal in three games immediately before the break and it&#8217;s no coincidence they&#8217;ve bagged 16 in five games since the Norwegian playmaker regained full fitness.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32117648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32117648" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-MCI-NFO-REPORT_1752765375_UP1EKC41IXFFO_2024-12-04T194629Zjpg-JS954526033.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32117648" width="960" height="690" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32117648" class="wp-caption-text">Class is permanent</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kevin De Bruyne (£5.8m)</strong></p>



<p>If Odegaard doesn&#8217;t float your boat then how about another premium midfielder?</p>



<p>City&#8217;s brilliant Belgian helped his side stop the rot in midweek with a goal and assist at the heart of a 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest.</p>



<p>De Bruyne also earned three bonus points to finish with an overall haul of 18 when he went off midway through the second half (20 total for the Gameweek including two points against Liverpool).</p>



<p>The 33 year-old playmaker has been limited to just 548 minutes this season but with Pep Guardiola in need of his big guns in the wake of a rare downturn in form, De Bruyne will surely be unleashed upon Crystal Palace and Juventus in Gameweek 14.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to be convinced of KDB&#8217;s abilities but it&#8217;s rare that such an elite talent has an ownership as low as 4.8%.</p>

<p><strong>Morgan Rogers (£2.7m) or Youri Tielemans (£3.9m)</strong></p>



<p>Many gaffers will have gone cold on Aston Villa players recently but Gameweek 14 looks primed for points on paper, especially after Unai Emery&#8217;s men returned to winnings ways against Brentford in midweek.</p>



<p>The Villains host 20th-placed Southampton on Saturday before travelling to RB Leipzig on Tuesday &#8211; it&#8217;s a good time to play the Bundesliga side as they&#8217;ve lost five of their last seven games in all competitions.</p>



<p>Ollie Watkins (£5.3m) produced 19 points in Gameweek 13 but he comes at a steep cost and continues to be substituted in the second half of games.</p>



<p>Rogers and Tielemans are more relatively affordable midfield options, both coming off the back of double-digit hauls.</p>



<p>The Belgium international has earned 30 bonus points this season &#8211; the joint-highest tally among all players, alongside Ryan Gravenberch (£3.8m).</p>

<p>AIR Canada is the latest airline to scrap free hand luggage for a number of economy passengers.</p>



<p>The new rules in place from January 3, 2025, will affect flights within the US and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/canada/">Canada</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32127485" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32127485" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NINTCHDBPICT000549808119.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32127485" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32127485" class="wp-caption-text">Air Canada has introduced new luggage and seat reservation rules</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyone flying on a basic economy fare will no longer be able to bring a free <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/29425660/suitcase-colour-to-never-pick/">suitcase </a>into the cabin with them.</p>



<p>Only a personal sized item like a handbag will be allowed for free.</p>



<p>The new costs will be $35 (£20) for the first bag and $50 (£28), or $65 (£37) for anyone who arrives at the gate with one that&#8217;s not checked.</p>



<p>Thankfully this won&#8217;t affect routes from the UK, with Air <span id="98b14f6d-957b-4428-9029-5d9d246070bb" class="suggested-link">Canada</span> operating from both <span id="af58ee3a-b7eb-4c14-9a65-85c3bd4103da" class="suggested-link">London</span> Heathrow and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/london-gatwick/">London Gatwick</a> as well as season routes from <span id="9d64acec-07c1-41f8-89b1-d06bcd17f0ea" class="suggested-link">Edinburgh</span> and <span id="c18d6916-de1a-4249-92a8-12a43bee3bda" class="suggested-link">Manchester</span>.</p>



<p>Economy passengers on the transatlantic routes will still be allowed a free cabin suitcase.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the only new charge Air <span id="88c42579-3a33-4b4e-ba49-13dcbd3a6b3d" class="suggested-link">Canada</span> is introducing <span id="d5f7654f-0489-408e-a7d0-83049e040727" class="suggested-link">next</span> month.</p>



<p>From January 21, 2025, passengers will also no longer be able to choose a seat for free.</p>



<p>Basic economy passengers will be given a randomly selected one when they check in.</p>



<p>However, anyone who wants to change it will have to pay a charge, although it hasn&#8217;t been confirmed how much.</p>



<p>It is yet to be confirmed if this will affect routes from the UK.</p>

<p>An Air Canada spokesperson said the new fees are to &#8220;align the airline&#8217;s fare structure with similar fare offerings by other Canadian carriers&#8221;.</p>



<p>A number of airlines have scrapped the free hand luggage in recent years.</p>



<p>Back in 2023,<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/22386886/airline-free-hand-luggage-scrap-finnair/"> Finnair scrapped free hand luggage</a> for passengers on the basic air fare.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/27789626/another-airline-free-hand-luggage-corendon/">Corendon Dutch Airlines no longer allow a suitcas</a>e into the cabin for free, as of May 2024.</p>

<p>The new series will run on BBC 1 and BBC iPlayer and tell five brand new stories over ten episodes. The new episodes open with the discovery of a pensioner&#8217;s body in a cave.</p>

<p>Silent Witness’ previously reached 7.4 million viewers, making it one of the UK’s most popular shows.</p>



<p>But fans have pointed out a problem with the long-running drama.</p>



<p>Jack and Nikki are usually joined by a third colleague at the Lyell Centre. For series 24 Forensic Ecologist Simone Tyler [Genesis Lynea]. </p>



<p>But she was absent from the show after the 25th anniversary episodes and replaced with Trainee Anatomical Pathology Technologist Velvy [Alastair Michael].</p>



<p>Now it&#8217;s been confirmed Kit is the newest addition to the Lyell, one fan wrote on social media: &#8220;The third team member seems to be a real issue for them. I didn&#8217;t like [Simone]; it felt so narrow a field that it was useful for more than an episode or two.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually sad that Velvy is going.</p>



<p>&#8220;For all I disliked Nikki&#8217;s love <span id="957d7062-dacb-4678-b9f5-c9e0e321e71b" class="suggested-link">life stories</span>, his whole thing was interesting, and he felt like a &#8216;whole&#8217; character who could contribute and be the cypher for the viewer through his naivety and relative lack of knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another said: &#8220;I liked the forensics part, but the character development was getting tiresome.&#8221;</p>



<p>A third said: &#8221; I have a small beef with the writers. Why do characters just disappear without an explanation?</p>



<p>&#8220;Just no explanation on what happened&#8230; love the show, but damn, it can be frustrating!!&#8221;</p>



<p>And a fourth added: &#8220;The inappropriate relationship between Nikki and Jack is a lawsuit waiting to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>THIS is the horrifying moment a pregnant woman is trapped in a runaway car with a brake failure &#8211; pleading &#8220;I can&#8217;t die today&#8221;.</p>

<p>The local County Sheriff&#8217;s Office received a chilling 911 call at around 2am on December 2 from the terrified woman behind the wheel.</p>



<p>She told them she was unable to stop her vehicle as she sped towards a lake at life-threatening speeds.</p>



<p>Footage shows how the car&#8217;s brake lights were turned on &#8211; but the car showed no signs of slowing down, maintaining around a 30mph speed.</p>



<p>In the heart-stopping clip you can hear the woman desperately screaming: &#8220;I need help. My brakes won&#8217;t stop. My car won&#8217;t stop. </p>



<p>&#8220;My brakes aren&#8217;t working. I&#8217;m 20 weeks pregnant. I cannot die today.&#8221;</p>



<p>Within a matter of seconds, a dispatch officer is heard asking her to turn right to avoid the lake.</p>



<p>But in a state of sheer panic, the woman frantically responds: &#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m scared. I can&#8217;t stop!&#8221;</p>



<p>The footage shows the woman&#8217;s car, with her flashing lights, continue to dart down the road &#8211; thankfully with no other vehicles around.</p>



<p>Responding officers caught up with her car to attempt to save the woman and her unborn child.</p>



<p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Office explained on social media that worried deputies at the scene decided it was unsafe to allow the woman and her vehicle to continue down the street.</p>

<p>They therefore orchestrated what&#8217;s called a rolling road block.</p>



<p>An official located the woman with the broken brakes as she sped down a road, pulled their own patrol car in front of hers before allowing it to hit the rear bumper gently.</p>



<p>The deputy then applied his brake, allowing both vehicles to slow down until they came to a full stop.</p>



<p>No injuries were reported but an ambulance crew checked over the pregnant woman out of caution.</p>



<p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Office patrol vehicle suffered no damage and very minor damage occurred to the already-broken runaway car.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear as to why the brakes on the woman&#8217;s car malfunctioned and led to the dangerous chase.</p>



<p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Office said on Facebook: &#8220;Had the Deputy not been on scene or delayed performing this maneuver the driver and vehicle would have likely gone into the water upon reaching the lake.&#8221;</p>



<p>More dashcam footage shows the moment <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31645083/moment-toddler-road-car-arizona-dashcam/">a toddler runs onto a busy road</a> in his nappy as a speeding car swerves to avoid him.</p>



<p>The tot stumbled onto the dark road &#8211; apparently trying to make his way across &#8211; before a woman nearby spotted him at the junction and sprinted over to scoop him up.</p>



<p>Dashcam footage from a driver at the scene recorded a woman&#8217;s chilling scream as she witnessed the terrifying near-miss.</p>



<p>She had her own little boy, aged seven, in the back of the car and said she felt &#8220;hysterical&#8221; as she prepared herself to &#8220;watch a child be crushed&#8221;.</p>



<p>The little boy, two-and-a-half years old, had wondered a fair way onto the road just outside Phoenix, Arizona, as huge 4X4&#8217;s hurtled past.</p>



<p>According to FOX 10 the traffic was moving at at least 45 miles per hour at the time of the incident on Sunday.</p>

<p>MANCHESTER UNITED practised defending corners in their warm-up before facing Arsenal&#8230; and still went on to concede from them TWICE.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/mikel-arteta/" rel="">Mikel Arteta</a>&#8216;s men went into the game with a reputation for being dangerous from corner kicks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ruben-amorim/" rel="">Ruben Amorim</a>&#8216;s side could not deal with the deliveries all evening as Thomas Partey and Mikel Merino also went close from corners.</p>



<p>So it will come as a major surprise to most <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196656/manchester-united/" rel="">Man Utd</a> fans that the Red Devils were preparing for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196653/arsenal/" rel="">Arsenal</a>&#8216;s corner-kick assault just moments before the match.</p>



<p>A video posted by <a aria-label="Manchester Evening News (opens in a new tab)" href="https://x.com/TikiTakaConnor/status/1864624688736960825" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Manchester Evening News</a> shows corners being whipped in as Man Utd&#8217;s defenders &#8211; who were in bibs &#8211; head them away while under pressure from some of their team-mates.</p>



<p>Yet it clearly did not work as they then looked all at sea for the corners taken by Declan Rice and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bukayo-saka/" rel="">Bukayo Saka</a>.</p>



<p>And fans on social media saw the irony in the training drill.</p>



<p>One said: &#8220;You can&#8217;t stop the inevitable <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another added: &#8220;They should’ve had Declan or Bukayo take the corners for them in the warm-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arsenal have turned into a prolific team when it comes to scoring from corners.</p>
<p>The Gunners have now scored 22 goals from them since the start of last season – seven more than their nearest rival Manchester City and eight more than Premier League leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p>Two of them came against Manchester United – Jurrien Timber and William Saliba netting in the second half to earn Mikel Arteta’s men a vital win as they chase down Arne Slot’s Reds.</p>
<p>Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka were the architects with their deliveries, and each now have seven set-piece assists since the start of the 2023/24 campaign – more than any other player.</p>
<p>United legend Dimitar Berbatov joked Arsenal are the new Stoke City of the top flight – a side under Tony Pulis who terrorised the so-called &#8220;bigger clubs&#8221; with set-piece mastery.</p>

<p>The conditional jockey has gone from complete unknown to Grade 3 winner after landing the famous Badger Beer Chase under lovable veteran Al Dancer last month.</p>



<p>The Sam Thomas-trained 11-year-old was given no hope of landing the prestigious Wincanton prize and sent off 25-1.</p>



<p>But Pritchard, who came through the same Rhondda schools system as current Wales rugby internationals Kieron Assiratti and Cameron Winnett, steered him home expertly to win by ten lengths.</p>



<p>It was a procession, with the jockey landing a £48,000 prize for owner Dai Walters live on the ITV main channel.</p>



<p>And the winners have kept coming ever since.</p>



<p>A blistering end to November saw Pritchard record four wins in six days including a Huntingdon double on favourites Grove Road and Gold For Alec.</p>



<p>While the most lucrative financially was the £6,000 success on Anthony Charlton&#8217;s former Cheltenham winner Rock My Way at Doncaster last week.</p>



<p>Pritchard was still playing rugby last year but packed it in with the threat of injury in the rough-and-tumble game too risky.</p>



<p>Mind you, not many would argue having an ambulance follow you round a track as you guide a 500kg animal over hurdles and fences is much safer.</p>



<p>Whatever your belief, there&#8217;s no doubt the move has proved a shrewd one in the simplest sense for Pritchard.</p>



<p>Now based with Sun Racing columnist Ben Pauling, he can look forward to more money-spinning rides in the future &#8211; and being snapped up by owners hungry for his services.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Things have gone incredibly well for me this season – beyond my dreams, really.</p>



<p>&#8220;You need to be given good horses – which luckily, I am getting at the moment – and then it’s all about making the most of your opportunity, just like in any sport.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pritchard got involved in racing pretty much by chance.</p>



<p>His girlfriend Hannah trained a point-to-point horse but had nobody to ride it.</p>



<p>So Pritchard &#8216;got a licence for the craic&#8217; and quickly found he was a natural.</p>



<p>As word of his skills spread so did the chance to ride better and better horses, culminating in Al Dancer&#8217;s win when Thomas&#8217; No1 jockey Dylan Johnston was injured.</p>



<p>Pritchard said: &#8220;A lot of my friends were jockeys so I always wanted to have a go.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I never thought in a million years I&#8217;d get to where I am today.</p>



<p>&#8220;It took me 30 rides to land my first winner, then I got a double the weekend after and it took off after that!</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s surreal… but long may it continue.&#8221;</p>



<p>With his talent only just being realised, there&#8217;s every chance it will.</p>

<p>BBC&#8217;s Strictly Come Dancing is getting closer to the end of the 20th series, and these are some of the hidden details you might have missed.</p>



<p>This year we&#8217;re getting set to see the final few couples take to the dance floor for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>, all in their bid to lift the Glitter Ball Trophy.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32131336" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131336" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/strictly-s-biggest-behind-scenes-954750425.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=584" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131336" width="584" height="346" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131336" class="wp-caption-text">Strictly Come Dancing is approaching its final, but there are some insider secrets you might not know</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32131338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131338" style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/strictly-s-biggest-behind-scenes-954750478.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=584" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131338" width="584" height="342" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131338" class="wp-caption-text">Strictly couples don&#8217;t get all week to rehearse, sometimes it&#8217;s just in one day</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rehearsals are squeezed in</strong></h2>



<p>The VT videos before each couple takes to the floor might make it seem like they&#8217;ve spent every day that week in the studio learning and practising their dances, but that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>



<p>Instead the couples are expected to do at least 12 hours of training for a dance lasting two minutes, but often this can end up squeezed in around other commitments.</p>



<p>This can sometimes mean learning a dance in a single day ready for performing on Saturday night.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/strictlys-backstage-secrets-restricted-rehearsals-25244658" target="_blank" aria-label="Daily Star (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Daily Star</a> in 2023, former professional dancer <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/aj-pritchard/">AJ Pritchard</a> said: &#8220;When you consider Sunday is your day off because the results show airs on Sunday night, but in the week you would usually be doing promo, going on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/lorraine/">Lorraine</a> in the week and talking about your experience to press, therefore you only get three and a half days in a studio to learn that dance.&#8221;<b style="font-weight:normal" id="docs-internal-guid-8482722b-7fff-b8c7-bb1b-47899aa3f08b"></b></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Song choices for the dances are chosen by the professionals</strong></h2>



<p>You may be left wondering how the dances are matched to songs, and whether show bosses decide or give out &#8220;easy&#8221; songs to stars on the show.</p>



<p>However the song choice is usually the decision of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/strictly-come-dancing-professionals/" rel="">dance professional</a> who can choose from a <span id="16e102ae-e4ea-419c-a9ad-cc0e98dd4244" class="suggested-link">pool</span> of tracks, based on that week&#8217;s theme.</p>



<p>The professionals choose their song, confirm it to production and then get choreographing and rehearsing.</p>



<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4456567/david-arch-strictly-come-dancing/" rel="">Strictly orchestra and band</a> have the week to perfect the vocals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scoring delays are down to production</strong></h2>



<p>On Saturday night there is always a delay from getting the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31766043/james-jordan-strictly-judges-sacked-overmarking-high-scores/" rel="">judges</a> comments to hearing their scores, and usually this is masked by chat in The Clauditorium.</p>



<p>The reason for the delay is down to judges needing to let the crew know what they will score each dance and what paddle they plan to hold up, so the production team can match up the scores on screen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Judges are given a &#8216;first look&#8217; of the dances</strong></h2>



<p>The celebrities performance on Saturday night during the live show isn&#8217;t the first time that the judges will see them dance.</p>



<p>Couples get a full rehearsal in the studio on Friday as well as dress rehearsal on the Saturday morning, with each judge allowed to watch it from their dressing room.</p>



<p>This allows them time to critique and prepare their comments, ready for the live show.</p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=99024&#038;game=polling"></script>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saturday and Sunday shows are filmed together</strong></h2>



<p>You&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking the Saturday and Sunday night shows are filmed on different days, but actually it&#8217;s all one long day of filming on a Saturday.</p>



<p>Saturdays start off with dress rehearsals for the celebrities before it&#8217;s time for the live show on Saturday night.</p>



<p>Once the live show ends, the results show is filmed straight after but isn&#8217;t aired until Sunday night.</p>



<p>This allows the crew and production team enough time to iron out any issues or errors before the episode airs on Sunday night to viewers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Group dances aren&#8217;t live on the night</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/30733387/strictly-fans-warning-bosses-spotting-format-change/" rel="">group dances</a> featuring the professionals typically kick off shows, but they&#8217;re not performed live.</p>



<p>Instead they&#8217;re learnt months in advance and often filmed well before the shows air.</p>



<p>The reason behind this means the professionals aren&#8217;t put under any additional pressure during a live recording, and gives them enough time to focus on their dances with their <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/30409986/strictly-fresh-crisis-more-celeb-pairings-leak-online-benched/" rel="">celebrity partner</a>.</p>

<p>PRINCE Harry addressing divorce rumours proves there&#8217;s turmoil behind the scenes, a royal expert has claimed.</p>



<p>The Duke of Sussex last night <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/32121313/prince-harry-breaks-silence-meghan-markle-divorce-rumours/" rel="">laughed off speculation</a> that his marriage to Meghan Markle was in tatters after the pair seemingly spend more time apart.</p>

<p>Harry attended The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/new-york/">New York</a> Times&#8217; DealBook Summit while <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/32121227/meghan-markle-red-carpet-prince-harry-new-york/" rel="">Meg beamed on the red carpet</a> in Beverly Hills some thousands of miles away.</p>



<p>On stage in NYC, Harry addressed why he and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/meghan-markle/" rel="">Meghan</a> aren&#8217;t often seen professionally together, which fuels split gossip.</p>



<p>Speaking to NYT Columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, the royal quipped: &#8220;Because you invited me, you should have known.&#8221;</p>



<p>He also laughed off divorce rumours, adding: &#8220;Apparently we&#8217;ve bought or moved house 10, 12 times.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it&#8217;s just like, what?&#8221;</p>



<p>But what Harry thought was him putting rumours to bed, actually highlighted his inner turmoil &#8211; after a life of speculation &#8211; claims a royal expert.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->
	<blockquote class="article__quote">

	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->




<p>Hugo Vickers told The Sun: &#8220;He said that all the pundits must be very disappointed, and he felt sorry for them that none of these things actually happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;What else can he say? He must be roundly fed up with all the kind of speculation that&#8217;s been going on over his whole life, ever since he was a little boy, so in that respect I sympathise with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>The royal author added the Sussexes are better off doing their own thing because they don&#8217;t thrive stood next to each other &#8211; and Meghan wants to make her own name.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Harry&#8217;s much better when he&#8217;s on his own talking about things without her there.</p>

<p>&#8220;And perhaps she&#8217;s better on doing what she does without him there, because he always looks a little bit spare.</p>



<p>&#8220;You could suggest that she&#8217;s making a move to be an independent person in her own right, I mean, we know who she is now, thanks to her marrying Prince Harry… She&#8217;s got much more of an identity.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;STRATEGY TO KEEP IN PUBLIC EYE&#8217;</h2>



<p>However, their solo appearances could be a tactic to keep themselves relevant and is &#8220;thought out&#8221; to avoid tension in the Sussex camp, Hugo added.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;They&#8217;re always playing to their particular skills. They&#8217;re also always having to reinvent themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re always having to try and keep focused in the public eye.</p>



<p>&#8220;And so if this is a strategy that he will do things on his own, and she will do things on her own, then you can be fairly certain that it&#8217;s been well thought out by them, and that there wouldn&#8217;t be any particular tension involved.&#8221;</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Harry also insisted he &#8220;very much&#8221; enjoys his life in the States, adding his focus now was on &#8220;being the best husband and the best dad that I can be&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;I very much enjoy living here and bringing up my kids here.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are activities he can do with his children that he &#8220;undoubtedly wouldn’t be able to do in the UK&#8221;, he said, citing concerns about security.</p>



<p>Harry is continuing to press ahead with a legal battle against the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/home-office/">Home Office</a>&nbsp;over his taxpayer-funded security to ensure his family&#8217;s safety.</p>



<p>And with that in mind, he and Meghan have <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/32119159/prince-harry-vows-to-remain-in-us/">no plans to leave the US</a> anytime soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ARCHEWELL FOUNDATION LATEST WORK</h2>



<p>It comes just days after the pair put on a united front in a glitzy new behind the scenes video.</p>



<p>The clip was released alongside an Impact Report revealing philanthropic work carried out by the Archewell Foundation.</p>



<p>The one-minute video showcased unseen footage of the couple at public and private engagements over the past year.</p>



<p>Cold Play&#8217;s Sky Full of Stars was played over the top of different clips including Meghan cooking with other women for<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/26197960/meghan-markle-cooking-traditional-afghan-food-refugees/"> The Welcome Project.</a></p>



<p>It also highlighted moments from their <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/29621495/meghan-harry-confirm-new-tour/">Nigeria and Colombia tours </a>as well as their<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/25825217/meghan-markle-prince-harry-valentines-trip/"> trip to Canada</a> for the Invictus Games One Year to Go countdown.</p>



<p>Clips showed Meghan&#8217;s panel appearance at the SXSW Conference in Austin, Texas on International Women&#8217;s Day.</p>



<p>Other scenes featured<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/30640497/prince-harry-says-he-knows-about-getting-into-trouble/">&nbsp;Harry&#8217;s speech at the Clinton Global Initiative&nbsp;</a>in New York City to raise awareness about protecting children from online harm.</p>



<p>More footage spotlighted the work Harry and Meghan have done with their project&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/29672451/meghan-markle-prince-harry-cbs-sunday-interview-new-project/">The Parents Network.</a></p>



<p>The Sussexes have been contacted for comment.</p>

<p>PRINCE Harry laughed as he broke his silence over rumours he and Meghan Markle are heading for divorce.</p>
<p>Speaking during The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/new-york/">New York</a> Times&#8217; DealBook Summit without Meghan, the King&#8217;s youngest son said he &#8220;very much&#8221; enjoys his life in the States.</p>
<p>Laughing off the speculation, Harry said: &#8220;Apparently we&#8217;ve bought or moved house 10, 12 times.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it&#8217;s just like, what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Addressing why he and Meghan aren&#8217;t often seen professionally together, which fuels split gossip, the royal quipped to a journalist: &#8220;Because you invited me, you should have known,&#8221; to the crowd&#8217;s delight, reports the Mirror.</p>
<p>At the event, Harry said his focus now was on &#8220;being the best husband and the best dad that I can be&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I very much enjoy living here and bringing up my kids here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duke went on to tell NYT columnist and event founder Andrew Ross Sorkin he opposes a social media ban for children because it could lead to family arguments and bullying by classmates.</p>
<p>Instead, he said such companies should be subject to greater transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>He said social media has “already been intentionally created to be addictive” so banning it or removing it, “creates all sort of problems”.</p>
<p>Harry said he doesn&#8217;t have his own social media accounts to help protect his peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to think at these things through the lens as a dad,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the world has become more volatile and more divided since social media has been around for 20 years,&#8221; Harry added.</p>

<p>AS a talented teenager, Louie Barry had the football world watching his incredible talent.</p>



<p>In 2018, he scored 10 goals in five games for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196702/england/">England</a> U15s at a tournament in Italy.</p>

<p>Before that, he won the golden boot at the Val-de-Marne tournament, which England U16s won.</p>



<p>After rejecting a contract with parent club West Brom, Barry embarked on a Spanish adventure &#8211; joining Barcelona to train at their famous <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/11409358/barcelona-youth-academy-players-ranked-messi/">La Masia academy</a>.</p>



<p>Aged just 16, he was the first English player to join La Masia.</p>



<p>However, a squabble over his registration with Fifa meant settling in Catalonia proved harder than it should have been.</p>



<p>Then, when Covid hit , Barry decided to leave to be with family.</p>



<p>It meant starting again, at boyhood club <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196670/aston-villa/">Aston Villa</a>, although his chances were few and far between.</p>



<p>Barry, to his credit, has found his shooting boots in League One, where he plays for Stockport County on loan.</p>



<p>With 13 goals, he&#8217;s the league&#8217;s top scorer and fulfilling the potential that led to former <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31059325/inside-jurgen-klop-lifestyle-wife-mallorca/">Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp</a> calling him &#8216;Little Jamie Vardy&#8217;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;I loved my time at Barcelona&#8217;</h2>



<p>After starring in West Brom&#8217;s youth side, helping them reach the FA Youth Cup semi-final and playing three age groups are, it was inevitable he would move to a bigger club.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196659/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196654/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a> were linked with the forward domestically, while he was invited to Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig&#8217;s academies.</p>



<p>PSG were the first in talks, when it appeared evident he wasn&#8217;t going to stay with the Baggies.</p>



<p>Then, Barcelona stole a march on the French club, even after a medical was passed with the Ligue 1 giants.</p>



<p>But, it wasn&#8217;t all rosy in Catalonia.</p>



<p>Soon after Barry signed a three-year contract with the La Liga side, West Brom filed a complaint to Fifa claiming they hadn&#8217;t received the compensation they were due &#8211; £235,000.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1232720/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> said they had, and ultimately a judge ruled in their favour that no more compensation was due.</p>



<p>That held up Barry&#8217;s international registration for three months, meaning he missed seven games of the U19 season.</p>



<p>He lived in La Masia, while his family remained in the Midlands.</p>



<p>In January, 2020 as Covid began to sweep the world, Barry decided to return to the UK because he wanted to see his family more.</p>



<p>Immediately, boyhood club <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10806365/aston-villa-west-brom-louie-barry-barcelona/">Aston Villa snapped him up</a> for a fee that could rise to £3.5million.</p>

<p>&#8220;I loved my time in Barcelona, &#8221; he told The i.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a bad word to say about it. But I decided to come back. Villa are 10 minutes away from my family home. I grew up there. I support Villa. I wouldn&#8217;t have gone anywhere else and I am so thankful they came in for me.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Klopp&#8217;s praise</h2>



<p>Chances were few and far between in Villa&#8217;s side.</p>



<p>But when the club was decimated by Covid, forcing 10 players to miss out ahead of a FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool in 2021, Barry was thrust into the action.</p>



<p>Incredibly, he would score the equaliser against the Reds, before they were beaten 4-1.</p>



<p>That performance saw German manager Jurgen Klopp praise the youngster &#8211; comparing him to a Leicester City legend.</p>



<p>After the game, he told talkSPORT: &#8220;The boys did really well. Little Jamie Vardy was a proper threat.&#8221;</p>



<p>Admittedly, Barry has revealed in the past he has studied Vardy&#8217;s game and movement on and off the ball.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32107995" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32107995" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aston-villas-english-striker-louie-629506006.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=661" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32107995" width="661" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32107995" class="wp-caption-text">Barry starred for Aston Villa against Liverpool in an FA Cup third round tie in 2021</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32108085" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32108085" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/0e2112f1-e219-4e7c-968d-3e5f670fc40d.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32108085" width="960" height="765" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32108085" class="wp-caption-text">After the game, Jurgen Klopp called Barry &#8216;Little Jamie Vardy&#8217;</figcaption></figure>



<p>He revealed: &#8220;I do work hard out of possession, and &#8216;cheat&#8217; isn&#8217;t the right word because I do track back and do my defensive work, but when I feel that the ball might be passed to me, or take a ricochet and come my way, I&#8217;ll come for the ball and then all I want to do is go forward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if I lose the ball a few times, I want to be as direct as possible.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It&#8217;s working out for him</h2>



<p>With Villa realising the now 21-year-old needs more first time experience, they <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/23233534/barcelona-louie-barry-aston-villa-stockport-county/">sent him on various loans.</a></p>



<p>While it didn&#8217;t work out at Ipswich Town and MK Dons, it&#8217;s all falling into place at Edgeley Park.</p>



<p>Barry has rediscovered his goalscoring form under boss Dave Challinor &#8211; and has 13 goals in 17 matches already.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32108145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32108145" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mike-morese-mi-news-alamy-947826169.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32108145" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32108145" class="wp-caption-text">In 17 games Barry has scored 13 goals &#8211; making him League One&#8217;s top scorer</figcaption></figure>

<p>He&#8217;s top of the goalscoring charts, as Stockport County chase promotion to the Championship.</p>



<p>Naturally, that has seen the youngster linked with moves to Middlesbrough, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/3735972/sheffield-united/">Sheffield United</a> and Sheffield Wednesday.</p>



<p>With Barry finding his feet, it would be hard to imagine Villa will let this asset go now.</p>

<p>MARRIED At First Sight UK bosses were forced to step in and cut violent scenes from the show, after a contestant threatened their rival.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/married-at-first-sight/">show </a>insider has said that there were two occasions where producers had to talk to contestants about their behaviour on the reality show.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32134419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32134419" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/angry-mafs-uk-fans-insist-949352071.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32134419" width="960" height="565" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32134419" class="wp-caption-text">Married At First Sight UK bosses were forced to step in and cut violent scenes from the show, after a contestant threatened their rival</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32134423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32134423" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/angry-mafs-uk-fans-insist-949351993.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32134423" width="960" height="551" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32134423" class="wp-caption-text">The girls’ row reached a new level which led to Holly being told off for “aggressive” behaviour towards Hannah</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of which occurred at a dinner party, as Hannah and Holly’s huge feud rumbled on.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31924277/mafs-girls-night-absolute-hell-screamed-at-hannah-holly/">Holly and Hannah hadn’t seen eye to eye </a>during their time on the show, after Holly confronted her over how she was acting with the other guys, despite being married to Stephen.</p>



<p>Hannah and Stephen hit the rocks during their honeymoon and failed to get it back on track weeks after.</p>



<p>But in scenes not shown to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/e4/">E4</a> viewers, the girls’ row reached a new level which led to Holly being told off for “aggressive” behaviour.</p>



<p>A show insider told The Sun: “Holly and Hannah were screaming at each other for quite a while, and Holly was saying ‘get round here.’</p>



<p>“She said ‘I’ll f****** floor you, come here and let me show you what I’m made of, I’ll wipe the floor with you’</p>



<p>“Then she got told off by producers for her comments and at the commitment ceremony Paul ended up saying to her ‘you were really aggressive and we’re not ok with it.’”</p>



<p>The insider continued: “Holly said ‘yeah I know it was wrong’ and she then apologised to producers but Paul was like ‘Ok so you’re not apologising to Hannah which makes no sense as you’ve just admitted you’re wrong.’</p>



<p>“Holly said she didn’t think she needed to apologise.”</p>

<p>And that wasn’t the only unseen incident to take place on the show, according to the insider, as another dramatic development saw a <span id="9ca0604b-a94e-4baa-bd2d-54337c18a040" class="suggested-link">wine</span> glass thrown at a contestant.</p>



<p>Viewers will have seen Polly showering her then husband Adam with red <span id="ba39fcfa-6f86-41ca-be4e-efb88b40316a" class="suggested-link">wine</span> after tense words were exchanged over the dinner table.</p>



<p>It came after their final vows concluded without a definitive decision being made.</p>



<p>They then locked horns in a blazing row that saw Adam declare &#8220;we had sex three times in 10 weeks.&#8221;</p>

					When is the Married At First Sight reunion episode? 				</p>

			<div>
<p>The exact date for the Married At First Sight reunion is yet to be confirmed, but 2024 series cast member Adam has hinted that it&#8217;s set to place in February 2025. </p>
<p>In an interview with fashion brand House of Cavani, the reality star said: <span style=", sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 300;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;text-indent: 0px;text-transform: none;float: none">&#8220;It&#8217;s not out yet but it&#8217;ll come out in Feb.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Polly was furious about him sharing intimate details in front of the group and showered him red&nbsp;wine.</p>



<p>But the show insider reveals that as well as the wine, the glass was also thrown by Polly, but it was never shown.</p>



<p>They went on: “Polly threw the glass at Adam’s face &#8211; she threw the wine then stopped for a second then threw the glass in his face which luckily Adam dodged and it smashed all over the floor. She got in a lot of trouble for it.”</p>



<p>A rep for MAFS UK has issued the following statement: &#8220;Polly and Adam&#8217;s argument is shown in the programme. </p>



<p>&#8220;The wellbeing of the contributor is of paramount importance and producers will step in should they witness any unacceptable behaviour.&#8221;</p>



<p>After weeks of dramatic dinner parties, the show will air one final reunion episode for this year’s series.</p>



<p>And The Sun can reveal<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32078771/mafs-uk-polly-refused-film-reunion-adam/"> Polly refused to <span id="d98cc644-6303-40c9-be39-2a7df6b86572" class="suggested-link">film</span> recently for the special,</a> which is set to air in 2025.</p>



<p>An insider said: &#8220;Polly didn&#8217;t attend the filming of the recent special, which will air in 2025, as she couldn&#8217;t face seeing Adam again.</p>



<p>&#8220;She has worked really hard on herself and her mental <span id="992ba5ab-bdad-41b8-847e-80a1b3be953e" class="suggested-link">health</span> since filming, and couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of reopening old wounds.</p>



<p>&#8220;Polly also copped a lot of backlash for her behaviour on the show, especially when she threw a glass of wine in Adam&#8217;s face, and she didn&#8217;t want to be put in a situation again where she might be cast in a negative light.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;M A Celeb is in a fix row after fans spotted the exact moment that Alan Halsall &#8220;should have won challenge&#8221;.</p>



<p>Last night viewers enjoyed watching the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/32124480/im-a-celeb-rigged-bushtucker-trial-coleen-favourite-win/" rel="">famous faces fight it out in Arcade of Agony</a> to get a ticket to Cyclone and immunity.</p>

<p>First up <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/danny-jones/">Danny Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gk-barry/">GK Barry</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/reverend-richard-coles/">Richard Coles</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coleen-rooney/">Coleen Rooney</a> each had to retrieve coins from fish guts before heading to the grabbers to win tickets.</p>



<p>This was followed by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/maura-higgins/">Maura Higgins</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/oti-mabuse/">Oti Mabuse</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/barry-mcguigan/">Barry McGuigan</a>,<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 14px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-indent: 0px;text-transform: none;float: none"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/alan-halsall/" rel="">Alan</a>, who were tasked with picking out balls &#8211; which contained tickets &#8211; among critters.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a> told the famous faces that the winning two from each trial would head into the final the next day.</p>



<p>At the end of the instalment the Geordie duo turned up at camp and told them that the final four celebs going through to the final contest were <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32117555/ant-dec-celebs-immunity-im-a-celeb-cyclone/" rel="">Coleen, Danny, Maura and Oti</a>.</p>



<p>Fans were baffled about how Alan wasn&#8217;t one of those considering he had loads of tickets in the competition. </p>



<p>One viewer said on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/">X</a>: &#8220;Deffo a fix&#8230; obvs maura, oti and Colleen not getting the votes <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">itv</a> want them to #imaceleb.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another wrote: &#8220;LMAO they fixing it so Coleen wins.. they not even tryna be discrete with it. </p>



<p>&#8220;Coleen appears to be chosen by ITV to win this whole show. </p>



<p>&#8220;Oti and Maura apparently beating Alan also seems a bit odd. Theres definitely a fix going on in Coleen&#8217;s and Oti&#8217;s favour #ImACeleb.&#8221;</p>



<p>A third added: &#8220;For the first time ever I’m calling #FIX why are people bothering to vote if producers do a sneaky ‘ticket count’ &amp; choose who wins #imaceleb #ImACelebUnpacked.&#8221;</p>



<p>It comes after The Sun exclusively revealed that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32122993/shock-twist-im-a-celeb-two-stars-booted-off/" rel="">two I&#8217;m A Celeb stars will be evicted</a> from the jungle in tonight&#8217;s episode.</p>



<p>The campmates will be hit with the surprise double eviction by hosts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ant-mcpartlin/" rel="">Ant</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/declan-donnelly/" rel="">Dec</a>.</p>

<p>They will also announce the winner of the ticket to Saturday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32063388/im-a-celebrity-cyclone-trial-spin-off-show-itv/">Celebrity&nbsp;Cyclone</a>.</p>



<p>This evening will see Danny, Oti, Maura and Coleen all take on a new trial &#8211; and they will also have to try and win stars while battling critters.</p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=99018&#038;game=polling"></script>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32091971/im-a-celeb-twist-immunity/">The celeb who wins will have immunity</a>&nbsp;from vote-offs until they have competed in the fan favourite challenge.</p>



<p>However, they will not be a shoo-in for the final as another celeb could leave camp on Saturday night ahead of Sunday&#8217;s final.</p>



<p>There was no eviction in last night&#8217;s episode after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32114443/im-a-celeb-fans-show-set-up/">battle to win the Cyclone ticket got underway</a>, with stars going up against each other in the Arcade of Agony.</p>



<p>The first four <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31965962/who-left-im-celebrity-campmate-booted-jungle/" rel="">contestants to leave the show</a> were <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/jane-moore/">Jane Moore</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dean-mccullough/">Dean McCullough</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tulisa/">Tulisa Contostavlos</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/melvin-odoom/">Melvin Odoom</a>.</p>

<p>A PRIVATE school head girl who faked her ex-headmistress&#8217;s will in a plot to swipe her £4million estate has been jailed for six and a half years.</p>



<p>Leigh Voysey, 46, wrote bogus final wishes for ailing Maureen Renny and asked friends to be false witnesses during a two-year plot to win the fortune from her grieving family.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32134565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32134565" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/07948286566-954700810.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32134565" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32134565" class="wp-caption-text">Leigh Voysey was allegedly favoured by headmistress Maureen Renny</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32134614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32134614" style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/hill-house-much-hadham-hertfordshire-722931648.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=685" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32134614" width="685" height="420" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32134614" class="wp-caption-text">Hill House, in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire was left to Voysey in Maureen&#8217;s will</figcaption></figure>



<p>The founder of the fee-paying Barn School, who died aged 82 in January 2020, left behind a huge £4.2million fund – including a sprawling £2.3m mansion in sleepy Much Hadham, Herts.</p>



<p>Mum-of-one <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18123721/private-school-head-girl-faked-will-headmistress/">Voysey</a> convinced <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/stansted-airport/">Stansted Airport</a> security officer Amber Collingwood and pal Ben Mayes to support her legal fight after claiming she “deserved it”.</p>



<p>The respected teacher returned home to her grand Hill House property after refusing long-term hospital treatment following a stroke in July 2019 and died in January 2020.</p>



<p>The trio were sentenced at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/hertfordshire/">St. Albans Crown Court</a> on Thursday after pleading guilty on day seven of a three-week trial for forgery and fraud at St Albans crown court.</p>



<p>Voysey, Mayes, 42, and Collingwood, 44, claimed the critically ill OAP had legally signed over her whole estate on a DIY will kit in September 2019, despite her being too sick to write.</p>



<p>The Homebase shelf stacker sued the Renny family in 2021 and challenged her real will, sparking a bitter High Court fight.</p>



<p>Her family reported the claim to fraud police who launched a criminal probe over the “crude” handwritten last wishes.</p>



<p>The fraudster claimed she reconnected with her former tutor nearly three decades after she left school when she took a one-off job with a care agency.</p>



<p>She said she later went back as a pal when the school founder suddenly declared she would pass the whole estate to her.</p>



<p>After she was nicked in 2022, Voysey told cops: “I went round there one day to talk to her, not about a will. She spoke to me about the will.</p>

<p>“She said, ‘I want to leave you the property. I’m concerned that if I don’t leave it to you, someone will try to develop on it’.</p>



<p>&#8220;She wanted me to have this. Whether she wanted me to have this because she wanted me to live there, I don’t know.</p>



<p>“She wanted it to remain as a school or a house.</p>



<p>“I was very close to her. She made me head girl. I didn’t force her to do it.” </p>



<p>Ms Renny’s February 2016 will divided the money between her cousins Gillian Ayre, Angela Eastwood and Susan Vickers, and the children of her stepson, Thomas Renny, and his wife Katherine.</p>



<p>Prosecutor Stefan Weidmann said: “The crown contends Ms Voysey never set foot in Hill House again after that 2016 shift as a carer.</p>



<p>“Leigh Voysey, together with her co-defendants, wrote a will purporting to be the last will of Ms Renny.</p>



<p>“That fake will gave the whole estate – lock, stock and barrel – to Leigh Voysey.</p>



<p>“Although it was dated the 12th of September 2019, it’s not exactly known when that will was forged.</p>



<p>“The fake will was written out by Ms Collingwood, who signed on behalf of the incapacitated testator, then further signed as a witness.” </p>



<p>&#8220;In earlier wills, the money was to be spread between her family and a number of charities that all stood to benefit.</p>



<p>“Each defendant maintained the fiction that this will was correct.</p>



<p>&#8220;Leigh Voysey stood to become a multi-millionaire.&#8221; </p>



<p>Gillian Ayre, who was an executor on Ms Renny’s real will, told the court of the claim: “I was aghast. I didn’t give it any credence at first… it was ridiculous.</p>



<p>“Defending this fraudulent civil claim, and supporting the criminal case, has consumed my life.</p>



<p>“I have lived with the fear of having to pay the money left rightfully to me by my cousin.</p>



<p>“I have found it hard to believe that an incredulous claim has gained this much momentum.” </p>



<p>Thomas Renny, 31, added the inheritance helped him and his wife buy their “dream” home.</p>



<p>He went on: “The life we had worked so hard to build was on the brink of collapsing.</p>



<p>“The likelihood of having to quit our jobs and lives, and move back in with my parents was becoming more realistic.</p>



<p>“I often find myself wishing I had never been left any inheritance in the first place.</p>



<p>“The feeling I have about what should have been a final gift has now turned to bitterness.” </p>



<p>Anne Faul, mitigating for Voysey, told the court she had no previous convictions and had a 10-year-old daughter.</p>



<p>Adding she already faced at least a £100,000 bill from the botched High Court case, Ms Faul said: “What started as Ms Voysey saying she had a claim on this property… she foolishly entered into litigation.</p>



<p>“She feels awful. She feels terrible with regard to what’s happened here.</p>



<p>“She will be in financial ruin as a result of these foolish proceedings.</p>



<p>There’s no other way to describe them.</p>



<p>“At this stage of her life, having worked very hard, having felt she did the right thing by her daughter, to find herself in this position (is difficult for her).</p>



<p>“This was not a sophisticated offence, but it went on far longer than it should have done.</p>



<p>“Ms Voysey is not a sophisticated woman.</p>



<p>“She’s somewhat naive and misguided. There are still potential issues there for her.</p>



<p>“She deeply regrets her actions.” </p>



<p>The court heard Ms Collingwood also had no convictions while Mayes was previously guilty of dishonesty and a Class A drug offence.</p>



<p>Sentencing the trio, Judge Jonathan Mann said: “This was an attempt to steal £4.2million from the beneficiaries of Ms Renny’s estate.</p>



<p>“You can call it forgery. You can call it fraud. It was an attempt to steal from someone who was no longer alive.</p>



<p>“It may well be that seeing Ms Renny in the way she was – that is, frail – that the gem of an idea occurred to her to steal the estate.</p>



<p>“This was a plan to steal millions of pounds for your own benefit and deprive those relatives and charities of that money.</p>



<p>“The evidence against you was overwhelming. There were documents from an ‘at-home’ will kit found at your properties.</p>



<p>“There were documents in your homes setting out what to say if asked – a script to follow.</p>



<p>“I find it arrogant that you have pursued a criminal trial in the face of this evidence.</p>



<p>“If I sound like I have little sympathy for the three of you, you are right. I have little sympathy for you.” </p>



<p>He added Ms Renny’s family had been put through “years of stress” and lost their “life savings over nothing”.</p>



<p>Voysey – the “main mover” behind the scheme – was jailed for six-and-a-half years for fraud.</p>



<p>She was given a concurrent term of four-and-a-half years for forgery and smiled at her family as she was led from the dock.</p>



<p>Collingwood and Mayes were handed three years and two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment respectively for forgery.</p>



<p>Fraud charges against the dodgy witnesses were dropped.</p>



<p>During the trial, the court heard Voysey had told her pals she would “win a mansion” from the fraud – adding that she “deserved it”.</p>



<p>Her <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/homebase/">Homebase</a> co-worker Fiona House, who called police after reading about the case in the news, said: “Leigh told me she has something very big to tell me and that it was a secret.</p>



<p>“She went on to say that she was going to win a mansion and an estate. She said she was going to do a fake will.</p>



<p>“I asked her why, and she said because she deserved it.&#8221; Voysey must also pay a £100,000 legal bill from the civil case after it was closed at the High Court earlier this week.</p>



<p>Hill House was snapped up by property development group Hill Residential in March 2021 for £2.25m.</p>



<p>The house was separated from the surrounding land, which was sold for £975,000 in January 2022.</p>



<p>It will be turned into 30 new homes and a “large public park”.</p>

<p>DRIVERS have the chance to get their hands on the &#8220;best hot hatchback ever&#8221;, featuring gold-plated wheels and a supercar engine.</p>



<p>The bizarre custom car is a pint-sized version of an iconic <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/31938839/cheap-classic-cars-2024-price-decline/">classic</a> with a legendary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/19572681/most-iconic-movie-cars-all-time-revealed/">TV connection</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 1984, genius engineer (or mad scientist) Franco Sbarro took a Ferrari 308, chopped it up and stuck bits back together to create something completely new.</p>



<p>The 308 was an icon of its era, having famously been driven by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/30243762/tom-selleck-unrecognizable-beard-blue-bloods-canceled/">Tom Selleck</a> as the titular character in &#8217;80s drama phenomenon <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2666546/iconic-red-ferrari-driven-by-tom-selleck-on-hit-1980s-detective-show-magnum-p-i-sells-for-150000/">Magnum P.I</a>.</p>



<p>But Sbaroo saw much more potential in the car and took it in a bizarre direction.</p>



<p>By shortening the frame and placing a specially-designed fibreglass body on top, he introduced the fabled Super Eight.</p>



<p>Effectively a 308 in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/30351157/best-selling-car-brand-unveils-sporty-hatchback-retro/">hatchback</a> form, it still retained the legendary supercar&#8217;s ferocious V8 engine despite its size.</p>



<p>The little car, which is about the same size as the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/27241916/renault-clio-price-style-engines-small-car-to-beat/">Renault Clio</a> from the same time, boasts a whopping 240 horsepower.</p>



<p>That gave it a top speed of an incredible 124 mph.</p>



<p>In contrast to its very typical rear end, it retained the Ferrario bonnet and front grille, as well as its characteristic bright red paintwork.</p>



<p>This is complimented nicely by the 15-inch spoked and gold-plated wheels that come as standard.</p>



<p>Inside, the whole cabin is decked out in plush dark caramel leather and uniquely designed to match the car&#8217;s titchy proportions.</p>

<p>This particular example has just 19,000 miles on the clock and looks to be in immaculate condition.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s now up for sale through <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/car-auctions/">auction</a> site <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1984-sbarro-super-eight/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Bring A Trailer</a> from its home in Paris.</p>



<p>The listing states: &#8220;This 1984 Sbarro Super Eight is a one-off hatchback designed by Swiss builder Franco Sbarro with backing from industrialist Bernd Grohe, to whom it was delivered after being displayed at the 1984 Geneva Motor Show. </p>



<p>&#8220;The car is said to have been purchased by its next owner from the Sbarro Museum and later spent time in a Swiss collection before being purchased by its current owner four years ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s got quite the price tag attached to it, with the current bid standing at almost £63,000.</p>



<p>But if you do fancy a go at topping that, you&#8217;ll have to be quick as there are only six days left to run on the auction.</p>

<p>NIKITA Hand has won her legal costs against Conor McGregor &#8211; as a judge refused to grant co-defendant James Lawrence his legal costs against her.</p>



<p>Disgraced MMA star Conor McGregor, 36, was last month ordered to pay victim Ms <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31886036/conor-mcgregor-nikita-hand-tears-statement/" rel="">Hand</a>, 35, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31901583/brave-nikita-hand-mcgregor-verdict-dpp-prosecute-update/" rel="">almost €250,000 in damages</a> after a High Court jury ruled she was “brutally” raped and “battered” by the thug in a Dublin hotel penthouse six years ago.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old mother-of-one lost her civil case against McGregor’s friend and co-defendant James Lawrence, with the court hearing the UFC ace had picked up Lawrence&#8217;s legal tab.</p>



<p>Lawrence&#8217;s lawyers maintained their client should be awarded his costs against Ms Hand.</p>



<p>A showdown over legal costs in the case, estimated at €1.5million with each of the parties represented by senior and junior counsel, took place at the High Court today.</p>



<p>Typically, the losing side pays their own legal costs and those of the other party.</p>



<p>But Ms Hand&#8217;s lawyers called for McGregor to pay the entire costs of the civil action &#8211; and argued her lawsuit against Lawrence was run as a joint defence.</p>



<p>Mr Justice Alex Owens, who presided over the trial, this afternoon decided the costs issue after hearing arguments from all sides.</p>



<p>The judge ordered McGregor to pay Ms Hand’s legal costs.</p>



<p>Mr Justice Owens made the award against the mixed martial art&#8217;s brawler at the ordinary level, not the highest level sought by Ms Hand&#8217;s lawyers.</p>



<p>And in a landmark ruling, the judge refused to grant Lawrence his legal costs against Ms Hand.</p>



<p>Mr Justice Owens ruled Ms Hand will not have to pay Lawrence&#8217;s legal costs because both defendants were &#8220;in lock step&#8221;.</p>

<p>The judge said: &#8220;The defendants filed a single defence represented by one legal firm.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mr Lawrence has a modest means and Mr McGregor was footing his legal bill.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;ONE NARRATIVE&#8217;</h2>



<p>&#8220;Mr Lawrence  and Mr McGregor went with the one narrative.&#8221;</p>



<p>The judge added: &#8220;It is completely inappropriate to award Mr Lawrence any part of his costs even though he succeeded in his defence against Ms Hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>During the trial, multi-millionaire McGregor told the court he was paying Lawrence’s legal fees.</p>



<p>Mr Justice Owens&nbsp; put a stay on all the orders until January 16.</p>



<p>This comes as the UFC brute is already reeling from a commercial “tsunami” as companies and retailers rush to dump <a href="http://thesun.ie/who/conor-mcgregor">McGregor’s</a> booze brands amid outrage at his sexual assault shame.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ONLINE OUTBURSTS</h2>



<p>After brave rape survivor Ms Hand won her civil action, the fighter proceeded to unleash a series of wild outbursts online.</p>



<p>Among his furious tirades, McGregor lashed out at the High Court where the case was heard, claiming it was “not a court of hard evidence and truth” but a “kangaroo court of opinions and feelings”.</p>



<p>The online posts were later removed after they were widely shared online.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->
	<blockquote class="article__quote">
		<div class="article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color">
			<p>&#8220;It is completely inappropriate to award Mr Lawrence any part of his costs even though he succeeded in his defence against Ms Hand.&#8221;</p>
				<cite class="article__quote-credit theme__copy-color">
					<span class="quote-credit">Justice Alex Owens</span>				</cite>
					</div>
	</blockquote>
	<!--googleon: all-->




<p>During the civil trial it was revealed that McGregor had paid Lawrence’s legal costs for him among the infamous sportsman’s “staggering legal bills” for the case.</p>



<p>Amid the fallout of the civil case, McGregor is also facing a growing commercial backlash after he was found liable of sexually assaulting Ms Hand at a Dublin hotel in December 2018.</p>



<p>The ex-double UFC champ, who took the stand to claim he had consensual sex with Ms Hand, denied all allegations.</p>



<p>But after six hours and 10 minutes of deliberations, a jury found against McGregor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DAMAGES</h2>



<p>Traumatised mum-of-one Ms Hand was awarded €248,603 in damages after the jury panel of eight women and four men found the mixed martial arts brawler had assaulted her.</p>



<p>The controversy has left McGregor – once among the world’s highest-paid athletes and who previously said he wanted to become a billionaire – struggling to salvage his fortune.</p>



<p>McGregor’s UFC comeback – he has not fought in the organisation since July 2021 – is up in the air after the civil rape case verdict.</p>



<p>The beast has also been hit by a commercial hammering as thousands of stores including Tesco, SuperValu, Centra and Costcutter stop stocking his alcohol brands.</p>



<p>Among the McGregor-linked products getting the chop is Forged Irish Stout, a beer brand owned by the former UFC champion.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31953600/conor-mcgregor-owner-proper-12-whiskey-ditch-name-likeness/" rel="">Proper No 12 Whiskey and Proper No 12 Apple Whiskey is also being pulled from shops</a>, with the whiskey brand originally co-founded by McGregor.</p>



<p>The company that bought Proper No 12 has vowed to stop using his “name and likeness” in marketing, as a wave of bars join the Brand McGregor boycott.</p>

<p>UBISOFT recently announced that it is shutting down one of its biggest releases of the year and refunding players for their purchases.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/28067731/xdefiant-servers-down-free-to-play/">XDefiant</a> is a free-to-play shooter that Ubisoft launched in May, but it has already been removed from stores, and the in-game store has been disabled.</p>

<p>Ubisoft announced in a blog post: “We regret to inform you that we are initiating the sunset process starting today, December 3rd, 2024. </p>



<p>“As a result, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, so stay tuned for more updates to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The servers will remain active, and the game will be fully playable until June 3rd, 2025.”</p>



<p>Those who entered the game before December 3, will be able to play all the way until June.</p>



<p>However, if you’ve never played, even if you’ve already downloaded the game, you will not be able to join.</p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom for XDefiant players as most of them can get their money back, including what they’ve spent on in-game purchases.</p>



<p>Purchases of XCoins in bundles between 500 and 12k coins made after November 3 will be refunded directly to your payment method by the end of January.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some other additional content will also be refunded, including any XDefiant Gold Packs, Starter Pack DLC, and Combat Pack DLC purchased after the same date.</p>



<p>Any XCoins or DLC purchased before November 3, will be ineligible for a refund, and that money will be gone for good after the game shuts down.</p>



<p>Only some of those who purchased Founder’s Packs near the game’s launch will get their money back.</p>



<p>Players who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack will receive a full refund, but Founder’s Pack and Founder’s Pack Elite players won’t get their money back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exit Defiant</h2>



<p>The story of XDefiant is unfortunately an increasingly common one in the industry with live-service games launching and then disappearing just as quickly.</p>



<p>We’ve seen numerous games launch, and then servers are shut down within the year before they have the chance to gain popularity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, XDefiant isn’t even the worst example of this in 2024, as PlayStation’s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/30247256/concord-shutdown-refunds-playstation-steam/">Concord broke records by launching and shuttering in the span of two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>The Hammers&#8217; woeful defeat at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/leicester/">Leicester</a> on Tuesday night has pushed Lopetegui to the brink of the axe, with a number of senior figures keen for a change to be made.</p>



<p>However, club chiefs have given him a temporary reprieve after two days of crunch talks.</p>



<p>Bosses acknowledged that results are far from good enough and that the defensive record must improve quickly.</p>



<p>There have also been concerns over instructions given to the squad, while the ex-Real Madrid manager&#8217;s heated clashes with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/mohammed-kudus/">Mohammed Kudus</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jean-clair-todibo/">Jean-Clair Todibo</a> during games have not helped.</p>



<p>Lopetegui faces Wolves boss Gary O&#8217;Neil, who is also fighting to save his job after losing 4-0 at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196662/everton/">Everton</a> on Wednesday.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196655/west-ham/">West Ham</a> are 14th are winning just four of their 14 Premier League games under Lopetegui this season.</p>



<p>The Hammers have gone backwards since <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/david-moyes/">David Moyes</a> was replaced in the summer and almost £130million was spent on new players.</p>



<p>Frustrated fans turned on Lopetegui at Leicester, chanting &#8220;you&#8217;re getting sacked in the morning&#8221; at the former Wolves manager.</p>

<p>SHOPPING online saves you time traipsing around stores &#8211; but it can be a disaster if the item that arrives looks very different to the website.</p>



<p>This is the case for one heartbroken <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/">Christmas</a> fan who was shocked when they opened up a £42 wreath they had bought for the festive period.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32132458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32132458" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/68a8ac8d-5b0d-46c6-b827-8a910673cb49_a6ac3a.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=625" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32132458" width="625" height="665" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32132458" class="wp-caption-text">A woman was shocked after forking out £42 for a wreath from Walmart and it looked nothing like the photo</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32132464" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32132464" style="width: 831px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/f109c9ac-200f-4c64-a376-50b8c8542d48.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=831" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32132464" width="831" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32132464" class="wp-caption-text">The  &#8216;wreath&#8217; was actually a cardboard picture of a wreath</figcaption></figure>



<p>One woman shared how she had ordered a nativity wreath from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/walmart/">Walmart</a> to hang on her door.</p>



<p>The item wasn’t cheap at £42 but appeared to be a large wreath adorned with pine cones, a large red bow and a nativity silhouette of Mary and Joseph.</p>



<p>Taking to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/1h55aes/my_nativity_wreath/#lightbox">Reddit,</a> the upset customer revealed the disappointing item that arrived.</p>



<p>The product was actually a tiny cardboard picture of a wreath instead of the real deal.</p>



<p>Adding a laughing emoji, she wrote: “My nativity wreath. Listed as an 18 inch diameter!”</p>



<p>She continued: “For the price, I wasn’t expecting the fullest, most perfect wreath …but nothing could have prepared me for this.”</p>



<p>The cardboard photo was also nowhere near the listed measurements, and the shopper shared: “I measured it at just under 17cm. The ad DEFINITELY said inches tho.”</p>



<p>“I think it was MDF.”</p>



<p>Thankfully she did get her <span id="6e9ea5eb-72ad-4684-9c78-c00c3b29064c" class="suggested-link">money</span> back.</p>



<p>She explained: “Walmart refunded my money no problem, but they did give me a small lecture about third party sellers. Lesson learned!</p>

<p>“I did get a refund, so it’s funny now and not rage-inducing.”</p>



<p>Many people were shocked at her yuletide disaster.</p>



<p>One said: “I keep seeing these and I always wonder how does this happen/how is it allowed?”</p>



<p>A second added: “I laughed out loud at how bad this is.”</p>



<p>Walmart has been contacted for comment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wreath fail</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first Christmas <span id="3b8ae376-f883-4431-9d54-1f5c1aa36ac6" class="suggested-link">fail</span> that has happened with a wreath.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/32034484/christmas-snowman-wreath-temu-shopping/">Tracey Robinson</a> decided to order what she thought was a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/31948085/christmas-garland-wreath-diy-asda-hack/">Christmas wreath</a> from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a>-based online giant <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/temu/">Temu</a>.</p>



<p>Upon a quick glance at the advertisement on the website, where the product is currently slashed to under £5, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/retail/">shoppers</a> can see that the white &#8221;wreath&#8221; comes with adorable snowman design and gorgeous blooms.</p>



<p>With hundreds of rave reviews and a bargain price too good to <span id="7267033a-d4e5-44b2-89cd-f50a7f815221" class="suggested-link">sleep</span> on, Tracey immediately added the purse-friendly Christmas essential to the basket before placing an order.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32034955" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32034955" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/i-wanted-get-festive-spirit-953369300.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=540" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32034955" width="540" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32034955" class="wp-caption-text">One woman was shocked when her Temu wreath turned out to be a festive door banner</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, when the package finally arrived and the Temu customer opened the parcel, Tracey was stunned to discover what the fabulous &#8221;wreath&#8221; really was.</p>



<p>Sharing the hilarious moment on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tiktok/">TikTok</a>, Tracey&#8217;s daughter, Rachel, was seen filming her mum holding the product &#8211; a door banner with a festive print.</p>



<p>Left in total stitches at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/fail/">epic fail</a>, Rachel wrote in the caption of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachelkirkbride/video/7441320138776857889">the now-viral video</a>: &#8221;When you buy a &#8216;wreath&#8217; off Temu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Needless to say, the clip has since taken the internet by storm, winning the duo over 5million views and close to 3k comments.</p>

					TEMU exploded onto the scene in late 2022, with people all over social media raving about the low prices.				</p>

<p>The company is a Chinese-owned digital marketplace &#8211; essentially an online shopping app where people are connected to the retailer directly while the app takes care of the shipping element. </p>
<p>The frenzy over the app is not completely unfounded either as it offers a wide variety of products, including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/fashion/">fashion</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/make-up/">make-up</a>, electronics and furniture. </p>

<p>The loophole is called the de minimis exception and it means they can ship goods valued up to $800 (£643) to the US without it being inspected or taxed by US customs. </p>
<p>Temu connects customers directly to manufacturers and only manages how the items are sent to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means Chinese vendors can essentially sell their products directly to customers and ship it without building a network of warehouses across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, they cut down on huge costs and ensure the product itself isn’t marked up extra.</p>
<p>While many of the products seen on the Temu app are from brands with extensive, original collections, many more are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dupes/">dupes</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/designer-brands/">designer brands</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>COLD WEATHER can do more than leave you shivering and uncomfortable. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31785268/amber-health-alert-everyone-at-risk-cold-snap-uk/">drop in temperature</a> can also make subtle signs of dangerous poor circulation more apparent.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32134377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32134377" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RB-05-12-POOR-CIRCULATION_GRAPHIC_7cd6a7.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32134377" width="960" height="838" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32134377" class="wp-caption-text">When your circulation isn’t working the way it should, some parts of your body may not get the nutrients they need</figcaption></figure>



<p>When your heart pumps blood around your body, it delivers oxygen and essential nutrients that your muscles, soft tissues and organs need.</p>



<p>Poor circulation happens when something interferes with your blood flow, such as plaque buildup, blood clots or narrowed blood vessels. </p>



<p>Diseases of the circulatory system are more common than <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/heart-disease/">heart disease</a> and cancer, affecting around four million people in the UK and accounting for almost 40 per cent of deaths each year, according to Dr Margarita Brida, a consultant cardiologist for <a href="https://guysandstthomasspecialistcare.co.uk/news/10-warning-signs-of-poor-circulation/" rel="nofollow">Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas Specialist Care</a>. </p>



<p>Your muscles and tissues can be starved of much-needed nutrients if blood flow to them is restricted and you might begin to experience telltale symptoms of poor circulation. </p>



<p>Many signs of circulation problems can be subtle, but it’s important to identify them early in order to address the underlying causes.</p>



<p>Dr Kaywaan Khan, a Harley Street <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gp/">GP</a> at private practice <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hannahlondon.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Hannah London</a>, shares seven warning signs of bad circulation with Sun <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/">Health</a> &#8211; from pale skin, to shivering and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/hair/">hair</a> loss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Pale skin</h2>



<p>Dr Khan says: &#8220;When blood flow to the skin is reduced, it can cause the skin to appear pale or have a blue-ish hue.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is because there are fewer red blood cells, which carry oxygen and give the skin its colour.</p>



<p>&#8220;As well as this, poor circulation can make the skin look dry, dull and lifeless.&#8221;</p>



<p>If you notice these changes to your skin colour and appearance, Dr Khan recommends booking a blood test with your GP to identify underlying causes. </p>

<p>&#8220;A blood test can help identify conditions such as anaemia or vitamin deficiencies that may be affecting your skin’s appearance,&#8221; he adds. </p>



<p>&#8220;Being able to diagnose the problem quickly means they can provide treatment quickly.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Varicose veins</h2>



<p>Noticed bulging veins dotting your legs? </p>



<p>These are what&#8217;s known as varicose veins and they are a common sign of poor circulation, according to Dr Khan. </p>



<p>He says: &#8220;They happen when your veins&#8217; valves weaken, causing blood to <span id="fc893ac9-a959-4c28-93d0-31f1db88209e" class="suggested-link">pool</span> instead of flow back to the heart efficiently.</p>



<p>&#8220;This buildup of blood causes twisted, swollen veins beneath the skin&#8217;s surface, which are blue or purple in colour.</p>



<p>&#8220;These veins, which are most frequently located close to the ankles and feet, might hurt, ache or feel heavy.</p>



<p>&#8220;If left untreated, varicose veins can worsen over time, so early treatment is essential.&#8221;</p>



<p>If you have lumpy veins in your legs or other parts of your body, it can be helpful to try maintaining a healthy weight and exercise regularly.</p>



<p>Using moisturising cream and putting up your legs where possible might also be helpful. </p>



<p>You should see a GP if you have varicose veins and you have symptoms such as as pain, itching or swelling in your legs or you<br>you get a sore on your leg that has not healed after two weeks. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Hair loss</h2>



<p>Noticing some thinning in your locks and more strands in your brush?</p>



<p>This could be another telltale sign of poor circulation. </p>



<p>&#8220;Poor circulation can prevent your hair follicles getting the nutrients and oxygen they need,&#8221; Dr Khan explains. </p>



<p>&#8220;This can result in weak, thin, and brittle hair, eventually leading to hair loss.</p>



<p>&#8220;While there are various causes of hair loss, poor blood flow is often a contributing factor, particularly in cold <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/weather-2/">weather</a> or for those with certain medical conditions that affect circulation.&#8221;</p>



<p>See a GP if you&#8217;re worried about your hair loss.</p>



<p>They may be able to tell you what&#8217;s causing it and recommend available treatments. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Tiredness</h2>



<p>Dr Khan goes on: &#8220;Feeling unusually tired or sluggish may indicate that your body isn&#8217;t receiving the oxygen and nutrients it needs due to poor circulation.</p>



<p>&#8220;When blood flow is restricted, your muscles and tissues lack the <span id="db5c8ce2-f89b-4ec3-8294-048cb3ab9c82" class="suggested-link">energy</span> to function at optimal levels, leading to excessive fatigue.</p>



<p>&#8220;As well as this, poor circulation can affect your body’s ability to regulate temperature, leaving you feeling colder than usual.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This can make you less inclined to move, which contributes to persistent tiredness throughout the day.&#8221;</p>

			<h3 class="article-boxout__headline">Causes of poor circulation </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p>There are various conditions and lifestyle choices which can contribute to bad circulation. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High blood pressure&nbsp;– this can weaken the blood vessel walls and restrict blood flow</li>
<li>Diabetes&nbsp;– too much glucose in the blood is bad for your blood vessels</li>
<li>Atherosclerosis&nbsp;– when plaque builds up inside the arteries, restricting blood flow</li>
<li>Deep vein thrombosis&nbsp;– when a blood clot develops in your leg, reducing blood flow</li>
<li>Varicose veins&nbsp;– damaged vein walls and valves can disrupt blood flow</li>
<li>Peripheral artery disease (PAD)&nbsp;– when plaque in the peripheral arteries stops blood from reaching the legs and feet</li>
<li>Pulmonary embolism&nbsp;– if a blood clot in a leg breaks off and travels to the lungs, blocking blood delivery to the lungs</li>
<li>Raynaud’s disease&nbsp;– if you have this condition, the blood vessels in your fingers and toes will get narrower when you are cold or stressed</li>
<li>Obesity&nbsp;– being obese can put you at a higher risk of medical problems that may slow blood flow, including&nbsp;high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol</li>
</ul>

	</div>




<p>He recommends: &#8220;Ensure your body is kept warm and properly hydrated, as these are the most common causes of lethargy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aim to drink eight to 10 glasses of water daily, which can include water-rich foods, sparkling water, and herbal teas.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important you&#8217;re wrapping up against chilly weather too. </p>



<p>&#8220;When stepping outside, ensure you are kept warm with a woolly hat, knitted gloves, thick socks and a plush scarf on top of your <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/">winter</a> coat,&#8221; Dr Khan adds. </p>



<p>&#8220;Try to limit alcohol consumption, which dehydrates your body and worsens fatigue.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Feeling cold</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that you&#8217;re feeling colder as temperatures outside drop. </p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re constantly finding yourself shivering, this may give you some clues about your circulation. </p>



<p>Dr Khan says: &#8220;Whilst it&#8217;s normal to feel colder as temperatures drop in winter, it&#8217;s important to monitor how your body responds to ensure that prolonged coldness or discomfort isn’t a sign of poor circulation or an underlying issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, in diseases like Raynaud’s syndrome, patients report white or blue fingers and toes in reaction to the cold or stress.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is condition where your blood stops flowing properly to your fingers and toes, causing pain, numbness and pins and needles in your extremities. </p>



<p>Dr Khan notes: &#8220;Along with changes in skin colour, symptoms like numbness, tingling, and frequent pain can be a warning sign of poor circulation which may cause prolonged discomfort.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Painful cramps</h2>



<p>&#8220;If you experience painful cramps during exercise, particularly in the thighs, hips, or calves, this could be a sign of poor circulation,&#8221; Dr Khan says. </p>



<p>He explains: &#8220;During physical activity, your muscles require more oxygen-rich blood to support increased movement, but poor circulation prevents your body from meeting that demand, causing cramping, discomfort or fatigue.</p>



<p>&#8220;After resting, the discomfort usually goes away, but if it keeps coming back with every action, it&#8217;s an indication that your circulatory system isn&#8217;t functioning at its best.</p>



<p>&#8220;This condition, known as intermittent claudication, often occurs in individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and can worsen without treatment.&#8221;</p>



<p>PAD is a common condition where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to the leg muscles. </p>



<p>Aside from cramps, it can cause hair loss on the legs and feet, numbness and weakness in the legs and brittle or slow growing toenails. </p>



<p>&#8220;Book in for a GP consultation to help determine the underlying causes of poor circulation, such as PAD or other health conditions,&#8221; Dr Khan advises. </p>



<p>&#8220;A GP can perform tests, evaluate risk factors, and suggest treatment options such as medication, lifestyle modifications, or additional testing.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Slow healing wounds</h2>



<p>&#8220;If you notice that cuts or wounds are taking longer than usual to heal, poor circulation could be to blame,&#8221; Dr Khan warns. </p>



<p>&#8220;When blood flow is compromised, your body struggles to deliver the necessary immune cells to the affected area, causing delayed healing.</p>



<p>&#8220;This can raise the risk of infection, particularly for those who have vascular disorders or chronic <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/diabetes/">diabetes</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Monitor for signs of infection, such as swelling, redness or pus and speak to your GP if you feel generally unwell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Keep wounds dry and clean, avoiding applying excessive pressure on the area.&#8221;</p>

<p>A MAJOR supermarket has apologised after it was forced to issue a recall of one of its products which it deemed a “possible health risk”.</p>



<p>Shoppers in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/england/">England</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/scotland/">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wales/">Wales</a> have been warned not to eat the popular meal because it contains molluscs, which are not mentioned on the label.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/waitrose/">Waitrose</a> has recalled specific batches it&#8217;s own brand &#8216;Chinese Takeaway Bag for 2&#8217; as it could pose a deadly <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/">health</a> risk for anyone with an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/food-allergies-intolerances/" rel="">allergy</a> to shellfish.</p>



<p>Affected batches only include those with use by dates from September 21, 2024 to December 4, 2024, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said in a <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-aa-57-2024" target="_blank" aria-label="release (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">release</a> published yesterday (December 4).</p>



<p>Customers are being urged to check their fridges and freezers for the potentially dangerous products &#8211; and told not to eat them</p>



<p>Instead, they&#8217;ve been asked to return the products to any Waitrose  store for a full refund, no receipt needed.</p>



<p>&#8220;We apologise that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused,&#8221; the supermarket said in statement. </p>



<p>The store has contacted all its customers and the relevant allergy support organisations, which will tell their members about the recall, the FSA said.</p>

<p>Around 0.2 per cent to 0.5 per cent of Brits are allergic to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/22743897/uk-most-common-allergy-egg-white/">shellfish</a>, including molluscs like clams, mussels, and oysters, according to studies.</p>



<p>With the UK population at around 67 million, this means roughly 134,000 to 335,000 people could be affected by a shellfish allergy, and this recall. </p>



<p>A shellfish allergy is considered to be one of the most dangerous allergies to have. </p>



<p>This is because some research shows that symptoms of the allergy come on faster than other allergens.</p>

		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					SYMPTOMS of an allergy usually occur within minutes of contact with with the offending food or trigger, but they can also come on up to one hour later.				</p>

			<div>
<p>Most allergic reactions are mild but they can also be moderate or severe.</p>
<p>Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of allergic reaction which can be life threatening.</p>
<p><strong>Mild to moderate symptoms include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Itchy mouth, tongue and throat</li>
<li>Swelling of lips, around the eyes or face</li>
<li>Red raised itchy rash (often called nettle rash, hives or urticaria)</li>
<li>Vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea</li>
<li>Runny nose and sneezing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Severe symptoms of anaphylaxis include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Swelling of your throat and tongue</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing or breathing very fast</li>
<li>Difficulty swallowing, tightness in your throat or a hoarse voice</li>
<li>Wheezing, coughing or noisy breathing</li>
<li>Feeling tired or confused</li>
<li>Feeling faint, dizzy or fainting</li>
<li>Skin that feels cold to the touch</li>
<li>Blue, grey or pale skin, lips or tongue – if you have brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Anaphylaxis and its symptoms should be treated as a medical emergency.</p>
<p>Follow these steps if you think you or someone you&#8217;re with is having an anaphylactic reaction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an adrenaline auto-injector (such as an EpiPen) if you have one&nbsp;<em>–</em>&nbsp;instructions are included on the side of the injector.</li>
<li>Call 999 for an ambulance and say that you think you&#8217;re having an anaphylactic reaction.</li>
<li>Lie down – you can raise your legs, and if you&#8217;re struggling to breathe, raise your shoulders or sit up slowly (if you&#8217;re pregnant, lie on your left side).</li>
<li>If you have been stung by an insect, try to remove the sting if it&#8217;s still in the skin.</li>
<li>If your symptoms have not improved after 5 minutes, use a 2nd adrenaline auto-injector.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not stand or walk at any time, even if you feel better.</p>

<p>GEORGE RUSSELL dropped a bombshell accusation that Max Verstappen said he would &#8220;put his head in the f***ing wall&#8221; in Qatar.</p>



<p>The ugly row between the Brit and the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/red-bull-racing/" rel="">Red Bull</a> driver has exploded into an all out war ahead of this weekend’s season finale in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>It all started last time out in Qatar when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/max-verstappen/" rel="">Verstappen</a> was hit with a one-place grid penalty after driving &#8220;unnecessarily slowly&#8221; and blocking Russell in qualifying.</p>



<p>Despite qualifying in pole position for his first race as a four-time world champion, Verstappen was forced to start the race from second, although he went on to win it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/george-russell/" rel="">Russell</a> said: &#8220;I have known Max for a long time and I know what he is capable of and he said to me he is going to purposely go out of his way to crash into me and put my f***ing head in the wall.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew that was a bit of a heat in the moment thing but when I went to see him the next day in the driver’s parade I saw in his eyes that he means it.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is a four time world champion and when I compare his actions to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/lewis-hamilton/" rel="">Lewis Hamilton</a>, Lewis is the sort of world champion that I aspire to be like. The way he fought Max in 2021, hard and fair but never beyond the line.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve got an eight-year-old nephew who has just started go karting, who watches all of my races.</p>



<p>&#8220;For a world champion to be saying he’s going to go out of his way to crash into someone and put them on their eff-ing head that is not the sort of role models we should be.&#8221;</p>



<p>Verstappen has been involved with a number of spats this season, including in Budapest in July when he crashed into Hamilton and fought with his own team on the radio.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a aria-label="CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/betting/21097803/casino-welcome-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>CASINO SPECIAL &#8211; BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS</strong></a></p>



<p>Russell added: &#8220;The second he does not have the fastest car, Budapest for example. He crashes into Lewis, slams his whole team and he loses the plot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Straight away after that race 25 percent of his engineering team were sending their CV&#8217;s to Mercedes, McLaren and Aston Martin because they said they can’t deal with a guy like that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lewis stood up to him in 2021, and Lewis lost that championship unfairly. Could you imagine the roles being reversed? I mean, [Michael] Masi would be fearing for his life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Verstappen doubled down on his scathing attack of the Mercedes driver, calling him a &#8220;backstabber&#8221; and a &#8220;loser&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Dutchman also accused the Mercedes driver of &#8220;lying&#8221; to influence the stewards’ decision to penalise him.</p>



<p>Verstappen said: &#8220;No [I have no regrets]. I meant every word. I&#8217;ve never experienced anything like that from the stewards.</p>



<p>&#8220;I found his behaviour really unacceptable.</p>



<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with him being head of the drivers&#8217; association [Grand Prix Drivers&#8217; Association, of which Russell is a director]. He simply lied about what he was or wasn&#8217;t doing, and certainly influenced the stewards.</p>



<p>&#8220;He’s backstabber. You shouldn&#8217;t talk too much about people like that, because they&#8217;re just losers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mercedes boss <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/toto-wolff/" rel="">Toto Wolff</a> crashed Russell’s press conference, dubbing Christian Horner a &#8220;yapping little terrier&#8221; after the Red Bull boss called the Brit &#8220;hysterical&#8221;.</p>



<p>SunSport has approached the FIA for a comment on Russell&#8217;s accusation but they are yet to respond.</p>

<p>A BRIT who was found dead at the bottom of a lift shaft while on holiday in Turkey was murdered, his grandparents say.</p>

<p>Collette and Ray Kerry believe their 20-year-old grandson was killed and have been left &#8220;absolutely disgusted&#8221; by the police&#8217;s handling of the investigation. </p>



<p>Speaking to The Sun through tears, grandma Collette, 56, said: &#8220;We are broken, we are all broken.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;I am so angry and frustrated that I am not getting anywhere in finding out why he died. </p>



<p>&#8220;I promise you that I am not going to stop until I find answers&#8230; I will find answers for my boy, I want justice for him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Initially, they thought Tyler may have fallen to his death on Friday morning after walking through the lift doors and directly into the cavity.</p>



<p>But CCTV footage showed the doors opening and Tyler walking into the lift carriage wearing his North Face joggers and pressing a button like normal, the pair say.</p>



<p>That and several other &#8220;beyond bizarre&#8221; things have left them believing their grandson was murdered.</p>



<p>Ray, 61, and Collette, of Basildon, Essex say it makes no sense why Tyler was found nearly naked.</p>



<p>Tyler&#8217;s vape, trousers, shoes, and cellphone were also found on level one of the hotel near to the lift shaft.</p>



<p>Collette said: &#8220;It [the vape] was covered in blood, that shows me foul play before my grandson was thrown &#8211; or whatever had happened with that lift shaft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know my grandson was murdered for the simple reason his vape was found on level one and he was found on the ground floor.</p>



<p>&#8220;If he has fallen, why would he not have his vape with him at the bottom of the lift shaft.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would that vape have blood on it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Forensic cops also took evidence from hand prints and a face smear left on an internal window on level one near the lift shaft, they say.</p>



<p>Collette said Tyler was also found with two black eyes which he couldn&#8217;t have received from a fall as the lift cavity is a &#8220;flat surface&#8221;.</p>

<p>His family and friends are also raising money through a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/tyler-kerrys-funeral-donations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gofundme</a> for his funeral and the legal fees they are expecting to pay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Last moments</h2>



<p>Ray and Collette last saw Tyler just hours before his death, at about 10pm last Thursday night, before going to bed and leaving him with some of his siblings watching the hotel entertainment.</p>



<p>Tyler had gone to a nightclub in the lobby of the hotel with his brother, cousin, and girlfriend where the group had been drinking.</p>



<p>Afterwards, at about 4am, his brother, Mason Read, left Tyler lying on a settee in the lobby to go and get a drink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when Mason returned he found only Tyler&#8217;s jacket and a tissue on the floor, Collette said.</p>



<p>Mason, 18, and the others went up to their room looking for Tyler &#8211; but he was not there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CCTV showed Tyler after he had got up from the settee, Collette said, being a &#8220;little bit wobbly&#8221;, and as he walked into the lift &#8220;turn to the right and press the button&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group looking for Tyler spoke to two hotel staff who pointed them in the direction of the lift shaft on the ground floor.</p>



<p>Collette said: &#8220;Eventually they found Tyler at the bottom of the lift shaft&#8230; there was Tyler&#8217;s body on full view because it&#8217;s a complete glass lift all the way round.</p>



<p>&#8220;No trousers on, no top on, no jacket, no possessions on him whatsoever.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Family slam hotel</h2>



<p>The grandma slammed the hotel&#8217;s response and said staff wouldn&#8217;t help with the investigating and wouldn&#8217;t provide them with CCTV of the moments that led up to Tyler&#8217;s death.</p>



<p>Collette said: &#8220;They&#8217;ve got quite a few CCTV cameras in the hotel but for some reason they have got no footage of any of his movements.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ray also accused the general manager of taking other guests sightseeing to where the vape and pants were found and telling the holidaymakers it was a &#8220;suicide&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collette said: &#8220;No way Tyler was suicidal, he was having such a good time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ray said the hotel wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;After that [the death], all they wanted to know was &#8216;when are you going home?&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been made to feel so uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Trendy Lara told The Sun: &#8220;We would like to share our heartfelt condolences to the family of Tyler Kerry who sadly passed away while on holiday at Trendy Lara Hotel.</p>



<p>&#8220;We did continue to provide support to Tyler’s family at this incredibly difficult time.</p>



<p>&#8220;As this is a police investigation we are unable to comment further.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Police failure</h2>



<p>The vape and pants were quickly handed back to the family &#8211; but Collette was left fuming after believing they could be key pieces of evidence that need forensic testing.</p>



<p>Only four people in the Kerry family group of nine on the trip were interviewed for &#8220;about five minutes&#8221;.</p>



<p>Collette said the police investigation was not thorough and they often battled through a language barrier to understand what was going on.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;They didn&#8217;t let us use Google translate and we were not willing to allow Turkish members of the staff at the hotel to be the translator.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Turkish cops confirmed on Monday that the death was &#8220;suspicious&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite that, the grandparents feel that Turkish cops rushed them and didn&#8217;t offer them fair translations of what they were telling them.</p>



<p>Ray said: &#8220;We feel like there was no investigation from the Turkish police.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like there was an investigation, I really don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>When cops in Antalya were approached for comment, they referred The Sun to the President of Turkey&#8217;s communication office who has been contacted.</p>

<p>THIS is the chilling moment an evil dad rants &#8220;none of your business&#8221; when he&#8217;s asked by cops about the starved son he buried outside.</p>



<p>Tai Yasharahyalah and wife Naiyahmi neglected their son Abiyah by failing to provide adequate food for the three-year-old.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32138922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32138922" style="width: 727px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAI.png?strip=all&amp;w=727" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32138922" width="727" height="412" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32138922" class="wp-caption-text">Tai Yasharahyalah argued with cops when they asked where his son was</figcaption></figure>

<p>The couple, who were described as weak and thin due to their strict vegan diet, left the youngster &#8220;severely malnourished&#8221;.</p>



<p>Mum Naiyahmi mainly ate raisins and nuts and after &#8220;cutting out all processed food&#8221;, the family&#8217;s food supplies &#8220;diminished&#8221;.</p>



<p>Abiyah suffered from rickets, anaemia, stunted growth, bone malformation and deformity in his short life.</p>



<p>His remains were discovered in the garden of his home in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/birmingham/">Birmingham</a> in December 2022.</p>



<p>The couple have now been convicted of causing or allowing his death following a harrowing trial.</p>



<p>They were also found guilty of child cruelty after failing to provide adequate nutrition or medical care and perverting the course of justice.</p>



<p>Footage released by police shows Tai arguing with police and accusing them of &#8220;trespassing&#8221; when they were called to the home over child welfare concerns.</p>



<p>He tells officers he and Naiyahmi had &#8220;renounced our citizenship&#8221; and claimed they &#8220;have no power or authority in my realm&#8221;.</p>



<p>The dad added: &#8220;If you have an issue then go and get a warrant. What are you going to do, arrest me? Go on then. Go on then. Go on. Arrest me.&#8221;</p>



<p>When officers handcuffed him, Tai confirmed his son&#8217;s name was Abiyah but refuses to answer when asked where he is.</p>



<p>He rants: &#8220;That&#8217;s none of your business. Why are you asking me this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Coventry Crown&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/courts">Court</a>&nbsp;was told Abiyah had fallen ill with a cold or flu in 2020, which his parents treated naturally with raw ginger and garlic.</p>



<p>He was discovered lifeless the following morning but his mum and dad kept him in their bed for eight days for a &#8220;ritual&#8221;.</p>



<p>Tai Yasharahyalah hoped his son would &#8220;come back&#8221; before embalming him with frankincense and myrrh.</p>



<p>Abiyah&#8217;s body was exhumed two years later, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/">police</a>&nbsp;discovering his birth and death had not been registered.</p>



<p>The couple had been evicted from the rented property but left their son&#8217;s remains in the back garden, the court heard.</p>



<p>When they were eventually found by police in a caravan in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a>, they said they had renounced their citizenship and were living as &#8220;sovereign and indigenous members of the Kingdom of Yasharahyalah&#8221;.</p>



<p>Officers observed they were both &#8220;extremely thin&#8221; with their bones visible through their clothing.</p>



<p>Mum Naiyahmi in particular struggled to walk and was described by police as &#8220;skeletal&#8221;.</p>



<p>In separate footage of the arrest, Tai claimed he had a bad back as he screamed out in alleged agony.</p>



<p> While Naiyahmi told police: &#8220;Do not come into my space. I am an indigenous person of this vicinity, this territory, this personal space right now. </p>



<p>&#8220;Leave now. I am not contracted to you under rebirth of Yasharahyalah. I have no affiliation with you. I have no citizenship.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prosecutor Jonas Hankin KC claimed the couple had &#8220;separately and together neglected&#8221; Abiyah by failing to provide him with adequate food and medical care.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;They deliberately chose not to provide or arrange for the provision of adequate nutrition and medical care.</p>



<p>&#8220;Instead they prioritised their cultural practices and beliefs over the child&#8217;s welfare, with disastrous consequences.</p>



<p>&#8220;The defendants claim that their behaviour throughout was in accordance with their cultural beliefs, principally their strict veganism, and rejection of Western medicine.&#8221;</p>



<p>The couple were remanded into custody to be sentenced on Thursday.</p>

<p>EMMERDALE is bringing back actor Mark Jordon after five years for Daisy Campbell’s exit storyline.</p>



<p>The actor &#8211; who played Daz Spencer in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a> soap &#8211; will make a brief return for his on-screen daughter’s swansong after she was axed after 13 years on the soap.</p>

<p>Actress Daisy told The Sun: “I end up going to live back with Daz in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/leicester/">Leicester</a>. </p>



<p>“Yeah, because we had a scene where I&#8217;d say, ‘I&#8217;m off to move to Leicester with Esther’ [laughter] and I end up moving back with Daz which is <span id="ca85c753-932b-461e-80e3-f78918ee449c" class="suggested-link">nice</span>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He comes back for one episode, which is lovely.”</p>



<p>But despite Mark’s return, Daisy’s exit left her feeling sad.</p>



<p>“Oh, it feels really sad,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s mixed emotions really I think. It’s been such a tough year, and I&#8217;ve had to deal with so much, but I was so at peace when leaving because I&#8217;ve grieved through it.</p>



<p>“Because I&#8217;m not only grieving for myself, it&#8217;s a character that I&#8217;ve always played, this is my first ever job from being seven, so it felt really sad.</p>



<p>“But then it was nice to close the door and be at peace, because I&#8217;ve just allowed it to play out as it has this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s really upsetting, because it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve ever known, but I mean new things and maybe new parts <span id="4c5d582f-2acc-4f68-91b5-325262e17e06" class="suggested-link">next</span> year. Who knows? But yeah, it&#8217;s been sad. It&#8217;s been really sad.”</p>



<p>She added: “It was weird, because we <span id="34a534f0-b8c4-47a1-b9ef-144069930005" class="suggested-link">film</span> in two-week blocks. </p>

<p>“So, the first week was really emotional, because Mark comes back. Mark Jordan, Daz, so it was lovely to see him again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So that was really emotional and whenever I work with Laura, who plays Kerry, she&#8217;s so good at doing emotions, the way she cries, I cry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But then the second week, I think I was used to it, because I was really dreading my last block, because I hate crying in front of people unless it&#8217;s for a scene. </p>

<p>EMBARRASSED Michel Barnier has resigned as French prime minister after losing a no-confidence motion.</p>



<p>Barnier, the former EU Brexit hardman, has now become his country’s shortest-serving prime minister ever in yet another humiliating blow to President Macron.</p>

<p>He will remain in office on a caretaker basis with his ministers until a new government is named, the presidency said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The prime minister today submitted the resignation of his government&#8221; to President Emmanuel Macron, who has &#8220;taken note&#8221; of the resignation, the Elysee said. </p>



<p>Barnier and his ministers remain &#8220;in charge of daily business until the appointment of a new government&#8221;, it added.</p>



<p>President Emmanuel Macron is clinging onto power after another damaging political blow saw his government left in disarray.</p>



<p>His government collapsed last night after a historic vote of no-confidence was passed against Prime Minister Michel Barnier in the National Assembly.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/emmanuel-macron/">Macron&nbsp;</a>is now on the hunt for his sixth PM during his stint as president but it comes amid calls for him to ultimately resign.</p>



<p>The president has constantly vowed to serve out his term until 2027 despite his political rivals now calling for him to step down immediately.</p>



<p>The deputy of the far-left La&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/france/">France</a>&nbsp;Insoumise party, Manuel Bompard, claimed today that Macron must leave to regain a sense of stability in Paris.</p>



<p>He told RTL France: &#8220;We are facing a situation of instability.</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not see, given the configuration of the National Assembly and the inability to compromise, a stable situation emerging.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also warned the next PM that they are walking into a poisoned seat.</p>



<p>Bompard is adamant that another Macron ally shouldn&#8217;t be gifted the prestigious role like before as all it does is reinforce&nbsp;France&#8217;s &#8220;democratic problem&#8221;.</p>



<p>Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has also blasted Macron for failing to step aside and says he is going to “sacrifice the fate of France because of his vanity”.</p>



<p>Barnier had already met with Macron today as it was expected he was to formally announce his registration.</p>



<p>The 73-year-old former EU&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/brexit/">Brexit</a>&nbsp;negotiator was only appointed in September &#8211; making him the shortest serving prime minister in French&nbsp;history.</p>



<p>Macron is also due to address the nation in a televised speech, according to the Elysee presidential palace.</p>



<p>The latest polls out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/paris/">Paris</a>&nbsp;say the people feel they are entering a period of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/politics/">politics</a>&nbsp;that is incapable of ever moving forwards under a Macron government.</p>



<p>Almost two-thirds of French citizens say they are in favour of him handing in his resignation, according to a Toluna-Harris survey&nbsp;for RTL.</p>

<p>A staggering 64 per cent of respondents agreed Macron should step aside immediately.</p>



<p>A whopping 94 per cent of people from the La France Insoumise party made up those in favour of Macron&#8217;s political demise.</p>



<p>Another 82 per cent of citizens say they now fear the&nbsp;future&nbsp;of France hangs in the balance with many worried about the economy in particular.</p>



<p>These people also took to the streets in protest over Macron and his failing authority.</p>



<p>Unions called for&nbsp;strikes&nbsp;and street demonstrations across the aggravated nation following the collapse of Macron’s latest rendition of the government.</p>



<p>One demonstrator was even seen holding up a placard reading: &#8220;Macron, you stink, get out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Many of those on strike are middle and high school teachers who want to send a &#8220;clear message to a future government&#8221;, the main union of secondary schools said. </p>



<p>Former leader of the Union for a Popular Movement, Jean-Francois Cope, agreed with the people&#8217;s feelings.</p>



<p>He told Franceinfo that the country won&#8217;t be able to continue under Macron until 2027 due to the constant cycle of issues.</p>

<p>Macron must accept that under him France&#8217;s democracy is clouded and unable to ever move on, Cope added.</p>



<p>France is already heading towards a period of political paralysis due to the latest PM departure with many predicting economic disaster too.</p>



<p>French bonds and stocks are already being sold off at an alarming rate as borrowing costs are now spiralling.</p>



<p>The political&nbsp;spectrum&nbsp;in Paris has teetered on the edge of chaos for months ever since Macron called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/29024994/disaster-for-macron-as-2024-election-exit-poll/">snap election in the summer</a>.</p>



<p>In a shock move Macron was left red-faced when New Popular Front (NFP) &#8211; a left-wing coalition led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon &#8211; <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/29035671/france-plunged-into-turmoil-before-olympics/">secured the most seats</a>.</p>



<p>Macron&#8217;s centralist party won the second most seats but it left them losing out on stability in the government.</p>

					EVEN though the no-confidence vote has now passed, PM Barnier will remain in his role until a new leader is picked by Macron.				</p>

			<div>
<p>Any new government is unlikely to be a majority, as none of the parties are near the threshold of 289 required.</p>
<p>Instead, a “technocratic” government would form &#8211; and the new prime minister would hold very little actual power until elections can next be held in summer 2025.</p>
<p>Macron was already in a weak position after France’s summer elections, which forced him into a partnership with the political right.</p>
<p>His last prime minister, Gabriel Attal, also headed up a caretaker government and regularly had to use a constitutional tool to force through laws.</p>
<p>This chaotic period severely dented Macron’s credibility as president.</p>
<p>The successful no-confidence vote against Barnier will surely make Macron less effective as a president &#8211; and his popularity could tumble even further.</p>
<p>The next presidential elections are in 2027, so Macron will remain in his post until then &#8211; if he can hang on.</p>
<p>Macron has no obligation to resign from his post now that the no-confidence vote has passed at the parliament. </p>

<p>OUR obsession with manicures isn’t decreasing &#8211; but visits to nail salons are.</p>



<p>The combination of lockdown salon closures and the cost-of-living crisis has sealed the fate of manicure appointments, with 40% of regular mani-devotees now visiting nail salons less regularly, according to Lopay. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32100645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32100645" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/manicure-diy-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32100645" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32100645" class="wp-caption-text">We put viral DIY nail kits to the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, our desire for preened and polished nails hasn’t changed.</p>



<p>As our salon visits become less regular, DIY nail brand sales are surging by 300%, according to <a aria-label="Nails Inc (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nailsinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Nails Inc</a>, and DIY nail art hashtags have clocked up over 6 billion TikTok views.</p>



<p>“As consumers realise that going to the salon is time-consuming and costly, more DIY options are entering the market beyond standard nail polish,” says Gina Farran, co-founder and CEO of DIY nail brand <a href="https://glaize.co/" rel="nofollow">Glaize</a>.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing – many DIY nail products don’t cut the mustard, either falling off in seconds, chipping instantly or proving impossible to apply.</p>



<p>So we’ve rounded up some of the industry’s most exciting products and dished them out to the toughest critics we could find: Team <em>Fabulous</em>&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>14 Day Manicure Signature Salon Pro Gel Polish Starter Kit, £170.50</strong></h2>



<figure id="attachment_32062193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32062193" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tested-internets-most-wanted-diy-953927592.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32062193" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32062193" class="wp-caption-text">The kit contains polishes, buffers, and files</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>RATING: 5/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Beauty Writer Mia Lyndon says:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“You’re literally bringing the salon home with this kit, as 14 Day Manicure is a pro-level brand used in nail bars across the country.</p>



<p>While it’s one of the pricier options out there, the kit includes nearly everything you need to open your own salon, including a LED lamp, cuticle pushers and files &#8211; let alone do your own nails. </p>



<p>You begin by filing –&nbsp; I find this step the trickiest, as it’s tough to shape my nails with my non-dominant hand – before brushing on the base, colour, and top coat, curing between each layer. </p>



<p>The kit includes four nail shades, which you can select upon purchase. </p>



<p>I love the brand’s glitter shades, as they have a radiant, high-shine finish that draws attention away from any imperfections. </p>



<p>While the polish doesn’t last quite as long as a professional mani, my nails remained chip-free for a week &#8211; impressive!”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Glaize Stick-On Gel Manicure, £14</strong></h2>



<figure id="attachment_32062190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32062190" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tested-internets-most-wanted-diy-953927630.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32062190" width="960" height="723" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32062190" class="wp-caption-text">This genius kit fakes the perfect mani</figcaption></figure>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 4/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Beauty Writer Mia Lyndon says:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“At first, I was convinced that a manicure sticker, which you simply press on to your nail, wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>But I was wrong. </p>



<p>After uploading some photos of my nails, the made-to-measure Glaize stickers whizzed their way over to me and fitted my nails perfectly.</p>



<p>I cleaned my nails with the provided Prep Juice, before attaching one sticker to each nail, sealing it in place by trimming the edges.</p>



<p>Once applied, the stickers have a soft, slightly sticky feel but provide the illusion of a glossy gel manicure. </p>



<p>After three days, the edges began to flake and lift, meaning I had to remove the stickers, simply by peeling them off.</p>



<p>These won’t last as long as a professional mani, and they’re not cheap, but they’re a faff-free way to prep your nails for a big day out.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mylee Marshmallow Crème CaraGel Solid Gel Polish, £7.99</strong></h2>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 4.5/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sub-editor Milcah Fajardo says:</strong></p>



<p>“This thick, creamy nail polish is unlike anything else I’ve used, but the results speak for themselves.</p>



<p>Crème CaraGel looks more like a cream blush or putty than a nail varnish, and arrives in a pot, so you’ll need a paintbrush to apply it &#8211; I’d recommend using one the size of a typical nail polish brush.</p>



<p>While this application method isn&#8217;t ideal for those with shaky hands like me, I eventually got the hang of it and applied three layers to each nail to fully cover up streaky brush marks, before curing with a LED lamp. </p>



<p>My mani was smooth, glossy and highly pigmented, and still looked fresh after a week.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ardell Gel Strip Starter Kit, £20</strong></h2>



<figure id="attachment_32062212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32062212" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tested-internets-most-wanted-diy-953927496.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32062212" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32062212" class="wp-caption-text">The set includes gel strips, wipes, and manicure tools</figcaption></figure>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 3/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Senior Designer Sasha Cunningham says:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“I’ve been keen to give this DIY kit a go – inside you’ll find a mini LED lamp and gel strips, which are like stickers. </p>



<p>However, there aren’t many size options, which might prove tricky for those with small nail beds. </p>



<p>Fortunately, this wasn’t a problem for me, so I smoothed the strips on to my nail beds, before curing them with the lamp and filing down the excess, which resulted in a glossy, high-­shine finish.</p>



<p>Despite taking extra care and wearing gloves to do the washing-­up, the strips quickly chipped, so I removed them after just three days, which was disappointing.</p>



<p>They’re great for a quick win, but don’t hold out any hope for these nails to last for an entire holiday!”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mylee 5-in-1 Builder Gel, £13</strong></h2>



<figure id="attachment_32062195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32062195" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tested-internets-most-wanted-diy-953927595.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32062195" width="960" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32062195" class="wp-caption-text">This clever formula creates longer, stronger nails</figcaption></figure>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 5/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sub-editor Milcah Fajardo says:</strong></p>



<p>“Builder gel can help lengthen, shape and strengthen your nails, but it’ll often set you back up to £50 in salons, so I’ve been keen to DIY it.</p>



<p>The buildable formula can be used to shape and elongate your nail bed, before curing and adding your desired nail polish or design over the top &#8211; a bit like papier mache! </p>



<p>The whole process was pretty much foolproof, and I followed it up with the <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mylee.co.uk/collections/gel-nail-colours" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Mylee Gel Polish, £8.99</a></strong>, which was so pigmented that I only needed to apply one layer.</p>



<p>The final result? A beautifully shaped, salon-quality mani, with no signs of chipping after seven days.”</p>



<p>Mylee&#8217;s Builder Gel can also be purchased from Boots for as little as £13 but there are limited shades. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Elegant Touch Petite Nails, £5</strong></h2>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 4/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Beauty Editor Tara Ledden says;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“I have tiny nail beds, so have always struggled to use anything but polish at home. </p>



<p>Whether it’s false nails or gel wraps, I’d have to spend so many hours trimming them down before applying them that the process wasn’t worth it. </p>



<p>With false nails, I’d have to glue them to the skin around my nail as well as the nail itself, which had them pinging off after a day, so I was very excited when these launched.</p>



<p>They took me less than five minutes to apply, which felt like a miracle.</p>



<p>I’m extremely hard on my hands (sorry to any manicurist who&#8217;s ever told me not to use my nails as tools!) and my dishwasher has been broken for two weeks, so I broke the golden rule and had my hands in warm water most days, but the first casualty didn’t happen until four days in. </p>



<p>While they’re shorter in length, it would be nice to see some smaller-width options, too, as I didn’t have much to choose from when it came to my pinky fingers.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MoYou Gel Strips, £12.99</strong></h2>

</div>



<p><strong>RATING: 3/5</strong></p>



<p><strong>Editor in Chief</strong> <strong>Sinead McIntyre says:</strong></p>



<p>“I’ve seen these semi­-cured gel nail strips – famed for being the quickest gel mani you’ll ever have – all over social media, so I’ve been eager to try them.</p>



<p>The kit contains sheets of flexible strips, which look like stickers, and are fairly easy to apply. </p>



<p>You stick them on your nails, file to shape, then use an LED lamp to harden them. </p>



<p>I was impressed with the outcome – it looked as if I’d had a professional mani – but the results didn’t last long. </p>



<p>I had a busy weekend, and was excited to show off my nails, but one came off in the shower, then I lost two more shortly after.</p>



<p>They are fine for a night out, just don’t expect them to last.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32114145/united-healthcare-ceo-shot-brian-thompson-nyc-killed/">Thompson, 50, died after being shot in the back</a> as he arrived at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan at around 6:45 am on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>The killer remains at large, but police released one usable picture of the man they believe is a &#8220;person of interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>It shows a smirking young man in a hoodie inside a hostel on the Upper West Side.</p>



<p>Cops have also recovered a phone in an alleyway near the Hilton they believe belongs to the killer, sources said.</p>



<p>They have obtained a search warrant to unlock the phone and go through its contents.</p>



<p>Security footage from after the shooting shows the suspect appearing to talk on his phone.</p>



<p>The suspect can also be seen on security footage buying a coffee, a water bottle, and two PowerBars at a nearby Starbucks just blocks from the hotel moments before the shooting.</p>



<p>Cops have dug out the bottle and coffee cup from a nearby trashcan, according to sources.</p>



<p>Police have also sought a search warrant for a hostel in New York City where they believe the killer may have been staying.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, can not comment at this time,&#8221; a spokesperson for the HI New York City Hostel told The U.S. Sun.</p>

<p>A man matching the killer&#8217;s description, wearing a dark jacket, hat, mask, and gray backpack, can be seen appearing to talk on his phone walking toward the Hilton Hotel at around 6:30 am.</p>



<p>He got to the hotel about five minutes before the shooting and lay in wait for Thompson, who was arriving at the hotel for an investor conference.</p>



<p>The killer appeared to be a skilled shooter, law enforcement sources said, using a silencer and gunning down Thompson from a distance of around 20 feet.</p>



<p>He was also able to recover quickly when his gun appeared to jam during the shooting, fixing the issue and continuing to fire as the CEO tried desperately to crawl away.</p>



<p>Disturbing footage shows the gunman pumping multiple rounds into Thompson as he arrived at the luxury hotel.</p>



<p>Following the shooting, the killer got on a bike and rode north on Sixth Avenue, fleeing into nearby Central Park where surveillance camera coverage is patchier.</p>



<p>Police have so far captured one usable image of the suspect without a mask.</p>



<p>Thompson, a married father, was rushed to Mount Sinai West Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:12 am, police said.</p>

<p><strong><em>What we know</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The search for the killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is closing in on a hostel where he is believed to have stayed.</li>



<li>Cops were spotted at a youth hostel on Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side.</li>



<li>Sources say he appeared to wear a mask most of the time he was staying at the hostel.</li>



<li>The suspect was reportedly seen in a nearby housing project before the shooting.</li>



<li>Detectives believe the gunman may have been an experienced shooter, based on the way he operated.</li>



<li>Speculation is rising that words &#8220;delay&#8221; and &#8220;depose&#8221; written on the bullets used by the killer may reference a 2010 book on insurance companies not paying claims.</li>



<li>Major health care providers have stepped up personal protection for their top executives following the shooting.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MYSTERY MOTIVE</h2>



<p>No motive has been released yet for the killing, but police believe Thompson was &#8220;specifically targeted.&#8221;</p>



<p>Forensics teams discovered a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32121834/healthcare-assassin-shooting-new-york/">chilling message left on the bullets</a> the killer used to murder Thompson in cold blood.</p>



<p>The words &#8220;deny,&#8221; &#8220;depose,&#8221; and &#8220;defend,&#8221; were found on live rounds and shell casings at the scene, police sources told the New York Post.</p>



<p>Those words could have been a reference to the book Delay, Deny, Defend, which covered insurance companies and why they refuse to pay claims.</p>



<p>There is speculation the killer could have been a disgruntled patient with UnitedHealthcare exacting some form of revenge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32132439/delay-deny-defend-author-bullets-kill-brian-thompson/">book&#8217;s author, Jay M. Feinman</a>, refused to speak following the murder.</p>



<p>A $10,000 reward for information related to the killer has been offered by the NYPD.</p>



<p>Police have urged the public to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS with any information.</p>



<p>His <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32128732/brian-thompson-unitedhealth-ceo-wife-paulette-kids-who/">wife Paulette</a> said her husband had been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32107023/ceo-united-healthcare-shooting-hilton-mitown-nyc/">receiving threats</a> in the run-up to his murder.</p>



<p>A fake bomb threat targeting Thompson&#8217;s home was sent approximately 12 hours after his assassination, as reported by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/05/murdered-ceo-brian-thompson-house-targeted-with-bomb-threat/" rel="nofollow">TMZ</a>.</p>



<p>It has been revealed the couple were estranged, with the pair living in separate homes less than a mile apart in suburban Maple Grove, Minnesota.</p>



<p>She paid tribute to her late husband in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thompson, who had been the CEO of America&#8217;s largest private health insurer since April 2021, earned a salary of almost $9.9 million.</p>



<p>He was with the company for 20 years and was reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice at the time of his death.</p>



<p>Thompson, along with fellow execs Stephen Helmsley, Erin McSweeney, and Tom Roos, was facing a DoJ probe after netting a combined $101.5 million from stock sales over four months before the public became aware of a federal antitrust investigation.</p>



<p>On February 16, less than two weeks before news of the probe went public, Thompson exercised stock options and sold shares worth $15.1 million.</p>

<p>This year, I’ve put items on my wish list that I’ve had my eye on for a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fashion-wise, I need some practical pieces such as a new trench coat and trainers &#8211; real <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/fashion/">wardrobe staples</a> that I know I’ll wear a lot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I’m also obsessed with this oh-so cute cardigan from Boden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A notebook always comes in handy &#8211; I love this Anthropologie X Papier one &#8211; and my travelcard holder is looking a little worse for wear, so this &amp; Other Stories number is the perfect replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, I fell in love with this Loewe candle &#8211; at £85, it really is a <a aria-label="splurge  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/dupes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">splurge </a>item, but it’s nice to treat yourself to something fancy at this time of year!&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, finally, I love cheese, so why not celebrate with a plate that really says how I feel most of the time?</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas/">Christmas</a> wish list includes both things I need to replenish and things I just hope to find under the tree.</p>



<p>I’ve been after a simple black, chuck-everything-in-it bag for a while and I love this JW Pei suede tote &#8211; it&#8217;s a fab DeMellier bag dupe &#8211; while I&#8217;ve been on the hunt for a tennis bracelet with round stones for ages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then I need my &#8220;essentials&#8221; replaced, like my perfume, face cream and slippers &#8211; my current pair barely even resemble slippers, so some new ones would be ideal please, Santa!</p>



<p>A cosy knit and a duvet coat finish off my extravagant list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the big day!</p>

<p>Plus, I&#8217;m loving these OG (that&#8217;s Old Guard) SL72 trainers (which I actually wore the first time around in green), this designer cushion from John Lewis and these elegant Missoma pearl earrings.</p>



<p>My gang will be spoilt for choice for what to buy me!</p>

<p>My family struggles to know what to get me for Christmas because I tend to impulse-buy. </p>



<p>So this year, I&#8217;ve made a mental note of a few things I&#8217;ve held off on buying.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been eyeing up the Anine Bing hoodie and Maebe jeans, which were super-hard to get hold of until a recent restock.</p>



<p>Tracey has also inspired me to try the triangular scarf trend, and this Zara one is a budget-friendly option.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t need any more coats, but this faux fur number has been catching my eye since it launched.</p>



<p>I also like to ask for top-ups of my favourite beauty items, including my go-to scent, Glossier You, as well as Vieve candles.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s hope Santa is feeling extra generous this year!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/author/clemmie-fieldsend/" rel="">CLEMMIE Fieldsend</a>, Fashion Editor at Fabulous, has shared her top tips for looking fabulous this Christmas. </p>
<p><strong>AVOID: Christmas jumpers<br /></strong>No longer a novelty gag, they’re now gone back to being naff and have no place at a festive party.<br />By all means, go all in for Christmas Jumper Day for Save The Children, but never wear it before or after that day.</p>
<p><strong>WEAR: Burgundy<br /></strong>You can’t escape burgundy at this time of year and it&#8217;s a luxury, deep and rich colour that is a welcome break from Santa-red at Christmas.<br />Opt for silky textures or velvet for extra style points.</p>
<p><strong>AVOID: PJs<br /></strong>The trend of feather trimmed co-ords has had its day and is so dated.<br />Don’t pull out your hair plucked pair this year, and don’t get a new set, instead still go for the satin two-piece but just steer clear of the plumes.</p>
<p><strong>WEAR: Sequin Dress<br /></strong>Try to switch up sequins slightly by wearing them with a different texture or colour, eg a sequin skirt with a sleek knit.<br />But when you’re really stuck on what to wear reach for the sequins, it is Christmas after all.</p>
<p><strong>AVOID: Sequin blazer<br /></strong>Nothing worse than showing up to a festive do looking like the hired entertainment.<br />Leave the sequin blazer to magicians and Strictly judges, instead always reach for a classic tux style or velvet.</p>
<p><strong>WEAR: Bling trousers<br /></strong>Last party season embellished jeans with diamante bling had a moment, and this year they’re going to be as much of a hit.<br />If you don’t want gemstones pinging off wherever you go then try metallic, PU trousers.</p>

					The Channel 5 Dalgliesh is a reboot of the original series which ran in the 80s.				</p>

<p>When crime writer PD James wrote the Inspector <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/16606431/dalgliesh-series-filming-locations-channel-5/">Dalgliesh </a>crime novels she may not have expected Britain&#8217;s leading actors to play the title role, including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/3591265/martin-shaw-actor/">Martin Shaw</a> and in the 2021 series, Bertie Carvel.</p>
<p>But, for many fans, Roy Marsden remains the most iconic Dalgliesh.</p>
<p>The actor played the lead role from 1983 until he was replaced by Shaw in 1991 who would later go on to star in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3564861/inspector-george-gently-bbc-one-cast-martin-shaw-gently-new-age-final-episode/">Inspector George Gently</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/16435101/the-long-call-cast-itv/">The Long Call</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking about playing the famous Inspector, Marsden told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/" target="_blank" aria-label="Mirror (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a> in 1998: &#8220;It&#8217;s an easy job, really.  Every 18 months or so I do a couple of months filming one.  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like what <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6343813/how-old-is-sheila-hancock-when-did-she-marry-john-thaw-new-film-edie/">John Thaw </a>did on Morse &#8211; he spent months slogging at it for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>FLU cases are four times higher than this time last year as NHS chiefs warn the health service is busier than ever.</p>



<p>England’s medical director Professor Sir Stephen Powis said a “quad-demic” of viruses is coming.</p>

<p>Winter is the busiest time of the year for the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nhs-crisis/">NHS</a> but wards are already 95 per cent full.</p>



<p>Medics fear hospitals will struggle to cope with waves of flu, Covid, cold virus RSV and vomiting bug <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32096453/children-vomiting-on-each-other-classrooms-bug-sweeps-school/">norovirus</a>.</p>



<p>Prof Powis said: “The NHS is busier than it has ever been before heading into winter.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/flu/">Flu </a>and norovirus numbers in hospitals are rising sharply and we are still only at the start of December.</p>



<p>“There have been warnings of a ‘tripledemic’ of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/">Covid</a>, flu and RSV, but with rising cases of norovirus this could fast become a ‘<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31446141/norovirus-quadrupledemic-rsv-covid-flu/">quad-demic</a>’.</p>



<p>“There is a long winter ahead of us.”</p>

<p>Figures show there were around 1,100 people in hospital with the flu last week, compared to 240 in the same week in 2023.</p>



<p>Another 1,400 patients were laid up with Covid and 750 with norovirus.</p>



<p>One in every eight hospital beds – 12,000 – are <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/news-health/21928244/bed-blockers-cost-nhs-billion-year/">blocked by patients</a> who are well enough to go home.</p>



<p>Patricia Marquis, director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: “There is barely a spare bed in our NHS.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/30799324/quarter-people-avoid-nhs-ambulance-fear-delays-poll/">Ambulance delays</a> are also longer than a year ago, with a third of patients waiting half an hour or longer to get into A&amp;E after arriving.</p>



<p>It comes as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32126619/keir-u-turns-on-manifesto-again/">Sir Keir Starmer</a> on Thursday pledged to fix the NHS backlog by 2029.</p>



<p>He said that will be the deadline for hospitals to hit the target of completing 92 per cent of planned procedures within 18 weeks – compared to 59 per cent currently.</p>



<p>NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said ministers should have a “healthy dose of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/29138977/nhs-waiting-lis-rise-highest-all-year-2024/">realism</a>”.</p>



<p>Chief executive Saffron Cordery said: “It is vital that the focus on bringing down waiting times for routine operations and appointments doesn’t come at the expense of other critical services for which patients also face long waits.”</p>



<p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: “An annual <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/30998470/nhs-winter-crisis-warning-bad-shape-delays-waiting-list/">winter crisis</a> has become the norm for too long.</p>



<p>“We will deliver long-term reforms that will create a health service that will be there for all of us all year round.</p>



<p>“I encourage anyone who is eligible to come forward for their flu, RSV and Covid jabs – it’s the best way to protect yourself this winter.”</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					THE NHS waiting list in England has become a political flashpoint as it has ballooned in recent years, more than doubling in a decade.				</p>

			<div>
<p>The statistics for England count the number of procedures, such as operations and non-surgical treatments, that are due to patients.</p>
<p>The procedures are known as elective treatment because they are planned and not emergencies. Many are routine ops such as for hip or knee replacements, cataracts or kidney stones, but the numbers also include some cancer treatments.</p>
<p>This is how the wait list has changed over time:</p>
<p><strong>August 2007: </strong>4.19million – The first entry in current records.</p>
<p><strong>December 2009:</strong> 2.32million – The smallest waiting list on modern record.</p>
<p><strong>April 2013:</strong> 2.75million – The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition  restructures the NHS. Current chancellor Jeremy Hunt was Health Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>April 2016:</strong> 3.79million – Junior doctors go on strike for the first time in 40 years. Theresa May is elected Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>February 2020:</strong> 4.57million – The final month before the UK&#8217;s first Covid lockdown in March 2020.</p>
<p><strong>July 2021:</strong> 5.61million – The end of all legal Covid restrictions in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>January 2023:</strong> 7.21million – New Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledges to reduce waiting lists within a year, effectively April 2024.</p>
<p><strong>September 2023:</strong> 7.77million – The highest figure on record comes during a year hit with strikes by junior doctors, consultants, nurses and ambulance workers.</p>
<p><strong>February 2024:</strong> 7.54million – Ministers admit the pledge to cut the backlog has failed.</p>
<p><strong>August 2024: </strong>7.64million – List continues to rise under Keir Starmer&#8217;s new Labour Government.</p>
<p><strong>September 2024:</strong> 7.57million – A one per cent decline is the first fall since February and a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>A WOMAN is believed to be one of the few captives still alive in the Hamas stronghold &#8211; 425 days after being dragged away by the terrorists.</p>



<p>Emily Damari, 28, is believed to be one of around 50 captives still alive in terror tunnels by the gun-toting savages.</p>

<p>Emily&#8217;s desperate mum Mandy spoke for the first time, making a desperate plea to get life-saving aid to her daughter as she fears she may starve to death.</p>



<p>Kindergarten teacher Mandy, from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/surrey/">Surrey</a>, explained how her life was saved when a lock to her safe room jammed which prevented the Hamas terrorists from entering her safe room.</p>



<p>But the terrorists managed to reach Emily &#8211; near her mum&#8217;s &#8211; and kidnapped her during the raid on the Kfar Aza kibbutz village during attacks which saw 1,200 killed and 251 kidnapped.</p>



<p>She was shot in the hand and suffered shrapnel wounds to the leg during the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/horror/">horror</a> &#8211; but freed hostages later revealed she had bravely helped <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/cheer/">cheer</a> up other captives in Gaza.</p>



<p>Emily’s beloved golden cockapoo, Choocha, was shot dead in her arms in the horrific ambush.</p>



<p>Mandy told a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/london/">London</a> <span id="779d97bb-d98f-49da-853d-e50f2660f98b" class="suggested-link">news</span> conference on Thursday: &#8220;I raised Emily &#8211; my youngest child and my only daughter &#8211; to love her British roots.</p>



<p>&#8220;She’s a massive Spurs fan with a great British sense of humour and her house on the kibbutz was always a place where her friends would drop by for a cup of tea.</p>



<p>&#8220;Or at least they did until October 7, 2023.&#8221;</p>



<p>She is now the last remaining British hostage being held by Hamas.</p>



<p>The family know that Emily was alive around eight months ago &#8211; but they &#8220;believe that she is still with us today&#8221;.</p>

<p>Mandy chillingly added: &#8220;Every day is a new death sentence for her in Gaza.</p>



<p>&#8220;Her situation is dire, and she desperately needs to be released along with every other remaining hostage&#8221;.</p>



<p>Fears loom among family and friends of what could possibly kill Emily &#8211; whether it be &#8220;disease, starvation, dehydration, torture, execution or friendly fire&#8221;.</p>



<p>Mandy believes that more could be done to keep her daughter and other hostages alive, &#8220;otherwise they will all die the most painful and tragic deaths imaginable,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Labour has resumed support for the UN’s Palestinian aid agency in Gaza &#8211; despite evidence suggesting its workers joined the October 7 attacks.</p>



<p>Starmer’s government has also warned Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu he could ”hypothetically” be arrested if he sets foot in the UK after a war <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/">crime</a> warrant was issued.</p>



<p>Hamas have blocked &#8211; or stolen &#8211; all aid ferried to the hostages during the Gaza war and only around 50 are now believed to be alive amid appalling squalor, danger and deprivation.</p>



<p>Mandy issued a heartbreaking direct plea to Emily’s Hamas captors.</p>

<figure id="attachment_32132127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32132127" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NINTCHDBPICT000954761767.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=757" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32132127" width="757" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32132127" class="wp-caption-text">Emily was dragged away by terrorist savages on October 7</figcaption></figure>



<p>She begged: &#8220;I want them to treat her with dignity and respect &#8211; if she is thirsty give her something to drink, if she’s hungry give her something to eat…just keep her alive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Britain has played an essential role in getting aid into Gaza, which I fully support but some of that aid must finally reach my daughter and the other hostages.</p>



<p>“The hostages are fighting tooth and nail to stay alive but they cannot survive another <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/">winter</a> with only our thoughts and prayers.</p>



<p>“Emily and I loved coming to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/london/">London</a> together around <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/">Christmas</a> time seeing all the lights and without her here it is another painful reminder of what I’ve lost.</p>



<p>“I want to thank you all for making me believe that she will make it back from hell and that <span id="683d2151-545d-4e22-bacb-24c997699bf7" class="suggested-link">next</span> Christmas season we can come back to London together.”</p>



<p>Mandy also singled out Labour Foreign Secretary <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/david-lammy/">David Lammy</a> for offering &#8220;warmth&#8221; during a meeting this week &#8211; but no action.</p>

<p>She thanked politicians including PM Sir <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/keir-starmer/">Keir Starmer</a>, Tory leader <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kemi-badenoch/">Kemi Badenoch</a> and Reform&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nigel-farage/">Nigel Farage</a> &#8211; who promised a personal plea to his pal <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p>But she went on to directly accused Lammy of ignoring the hostage&#8217;s plight after giving the impression he would help.</p>



<p>Mandy &#8211; speaking in London yesterday &#8211; said: &#8220;Regrettably, not all of my experiences this week have generated positive momentum.</p>



<p>“On Monday I spoke at the annual Labour Friends of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/israel/">Israel</a> event in front of around 100 Labour MPs, including the Foreign Secretary.</p>



<p>“I repeatedly asked for action on the hostage aid situation and I estimated that my call to action had been well received.</p>



<p>“But after a few hours, the Foreign Secretary published a statement on the need for <span id="348ddb8e-e51f-471d-a10e-bdf6cf885bb6" class="suggested-link">Israel</span> to allow more aid into Gaza for the winter.</p>



<p>“There was no mention of the need to get any of that aid to Emily and the other hostages and no additional remarks have been made on the subject since then.</p>



<p>“I appreciate the Foreign Secretary’s warmth in our personal meeting, but I came for solutions &#8211; not sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>RAIELE was just 26 years old when she was brutally raped and murdered in her room, deep in the Brazilian jungle, at the hands of an illegal gold mining gang.</p>



<p>“She fought so hard for her life, so much, that her blood was all over the walls,” says her sister, Railane.</p>

<p>“There were no bones or anything left from all the beating that killed her.”</p>



<p>The tragic mum is one of the many victims of the “wild west” gold rush underway in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/brazil/" rel="">South American</a> country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, deep in the Amazon rainforest, women face the risk of beatings or <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime/" rel="">murder</a> at the hands of gold prospectors.</p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/bbc/" rel="">BBC documentary</a> has uncovered the secret world of the illegal gold mines known as ‘garimpos.’</p>



<p>Impoverished women who go to work as cooks or in bars find themselves drawn into<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/sex-industry/" rel=""> prostitution</a>.</p>



<p>And as the new programme titled Sex For Gold reveals, some who refuse to sleep with the men end up being brutally slain.</p>



<p>The government in Brazil has been trying to tackle the problem of illicit gold mines, which cause <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/amazon-rainforest/" rel="">deforestation</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/climate-change-environment/" rel="">poison the rivers</a> with the mercury used in the extraction process.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gangsters-and-criminals/" rel="">mining gangs</a> are heavily armed and prone to violence and Raiele is not the only young woman to suffer.</p>



<p>The horrific experiences of other <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/30411809/aurora-strip-ordinary-seattle-street-magnet-pimps-gangs/" rel="">workers</a> is revealed in the World Service documentary for the BBC 100 Women season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Violent Gangs</h2>



<p>Mother-of-seven Dayane, 34, tells how she has been working in the mines since she was aged 12.</p>



<p>Her jobs included cook, washerwoman, bar employee and sex worker.</p>



<p>She left out of fear after a miner threatened to shoot her.</p>



<p>Dayane says: “The women are very humiliated there, slapped in the face. The women who work in the bars are at risk of violence.</p>



<p>“I was sleeping in the bedroom and a guy jumped through and put a gun to my head because I said I wasn&#8217;t going without money.</p>



<p>“They pay, they also want to own women.”</p>

<p>Despite that, Dayane was considering returning to the mines to earn enough money to set up her own business.</p>



<p>The bars and brothels in the mines near Itaituba, known as Gold Nugget City, are little more than wooden shacks.</p>



<p>To make it to the village, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/crime-documentaries/" rel="">documentary</a> crew had to travel for more than eleven hours on unpaved roads.</p>



<p>Director Emma Ailes tells The Sun: “If it rains and you get stuck, there’s no one coming to help you. And that was a mine you can get to by road &#8211; some of these women go on a small plane, or by boat.</p>



<p>“It has a very wild and lawless feeling.”</p>



<p>Far from civilisation, the settlements near the mines are no more developed than the roads that lead to them.</p>

<p>Emma adds: “The living conditions in those mines really is rudimentary &#8211; they have to bring in a generator for electricity, a cooker, but you’re really living in the open air, and you’re next to an open bit mine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s mosquitoes, there’s malaria &#8211; it’s a very hard way of life.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gold Rush </h2>



<p>The male miners come back from the forests, where they often work in a small gang with just one digger, after getting hold of the most precious metal.</p>



<p>Being in plentiful supply, gold nuggets are used as the currency in these areas, instead of money.</p>



<p>Producer Thais Carranca, who uncovered the exploitation, saw this for herself in Itaituba.</p>



<p>She says: “If you are going to buy beer in a bar, you’re probably going to pay in gold.”</p>

<p>Some of the miners decide to spend it on the intimate company of women.</p>



<p>Natalia, who is a brothel madam, says that sex workers can earn in one day what a Brazilian on the minimum wage gets in a month.</p>



<p>She has got a moped, fancy bathroom and a “really big bed.”</p>



<p>Natalia boasts: “It’s the girls who work who dictate ‘I want to be paid in gold, one, two, three grams.’”</p>



<p>But she is also considering quitting because “my quota is up.”</p>



<p>Luanna, a friend of Raiele, prefers to work in the bars in the cities because it is too dangerous out at the garimpos.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->

<p>They say: “Inside the gold mines you cannot lose your temper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You lose your temper for anything, it’s bang they get rid of you, kill you right there.”</p>



<p>Another sex worker believes that the mines are far more dangerous for women than men.</p>



<p>She comments: “I was born in the mines, I live in the mines, but now I am afraid to stay in the mines.</p>



<p>“A lot of women die on a daily basis, more women than men.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bloody bounty</h2>



<p>Despite this, many of the women working at the mines are following in the footsteps of their mothers and grandmothers.</p>



<p>While desperate to break this generational cycle, the gold is their only shot at saving their daughters from a similar fate.</p>

<p>Itaituba is in Pará state, which produces three quarters of Brazil’s illegal gold.</p>



<p>A lot of this bounty ends up in Europe, with around £74 million worth from Brazil linked to the illegal trade according to the Escolhas Institute.</p>



<p>Much of this also ends up in the UK, Emma added.</p>



<p>She says: “It’s the gold in your phone, it’s the ring on your finger.</p>



<p>“You might not know it, but that gold has come from places that are perpetuating this cycle these women are living.”</p>



<p>The authorities have sent in armed police and the military to remove the secret digs and destroy machinery.</p>



<p>There are more than 4,470 “wildcat” mining sites in the Amazon, with around half of them in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>

		<div class="article-boxout__header theme__background-color">
			<h3 class="article-boxout__headline">How much illegal gold is in the UK?</h3>

		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					More than 90 per cent of gold exports from Brazil to Europe come from areas where the illegal mines are located, according to the Instituto Escolhas think tank				</p>

			<div>
<p>And along with Canada and Switzerland, the UK is one of the three largest customers of Brazilian gold.</p>
<p>Although there are large areas of industrial mining in parts of Brazil, which are legal and often state-funded, the illegal garimpos are small scale, crude operations.</p>
<p>A report by the think tank found that 1.5 metric tons of gold exported to  the European Union were potentially linked to the garimpos, valued at over £73 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data from the World Wildlife Foundation showed that only 9.5 per cent of gold mining sites in Brazil could be shown to be completely legitimate.</p>
<p>Much of the gold traded ends up in the UK, where it makes its way into products from jewellery to electronics.</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell just how much of this gold is connected to the illegal Amazonian mines, due to opaque supply chains.</p>
<p>Gold passes through many stages before it ends up on our shores, and is often mixed with together with gold from other sources. </p>
<p>However, given the high proportion of illegal gold coming out of Brazil, and the high amount of gold imported into the UK from Brazil, it is inevitable that much of it is connected to the exploitation and suffering in the garimpos.</p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>Often the gold is discovered on indigenous lands, which are protected by law.</p>



<p>The police in Brazil have seized luxury cars and jewellery as part of Operation Greed which is aimed at breaking the ties of the criminal mining trade.</p>



<p>But with so much money to be made it is unlikely to wipe out the dangerous business.</p>

<p>Muhammad is now the most popular boys name in England and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/wales/">Wales</a>, jumping up one place from the previous year.</p>



<p>In 2023, a whopping 4,600 baby boys were named Muhammed, 500 more than 2022 &#8211; where it was in second place.</p>



<p>It swapped places with Noah which fell from number one with 204 fewer baby names than the year before.</p>



<p>In third place stands Oliver which has taken the final podium spot from the name George with a total of 3,556 little Olivers arriving.</p>



<p>As for girls names, the top three have remained the same for the past two years.</p>



<p>In number one is Olivia with 2,906 names, Amelia with 2,663, and Isla with 2,337.</p>



<p>Oliva is the long serving champion and has held the crown for the top-ranked <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/pregnancy-childbirth/">baby</a> girl name since 2016.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t shaken its popularity for nearly two decades and has remained in the top three girls name&#8217;s every year since 2006.</p>

<p>These rankings were compiled using the precise spellings of names as recorded at birth registration, so similar names with different spellings were counted separately.</p>



<p>Three different versions of Muhammed made the top 100 list and included variations like Mohammed at number 28 and Mohammad at 68.</p>



<p>The name with the exact spelling o Muhammed is the top of the trio and first entered the rankings in the mid-90s.</p>



<p>It was the top boys name in four of nine regions in England, and Olivia was the most popular in five out of nine regions.</p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=99089&#038;game=polling"></script>



<p>Both Muhammed and Olivia were the top names for tots in Wales.</p>



<p>New additions in the baby name rankings include Jax, Enzo, an Bhodi for baby boys.</p>



<p>Bhodi soared up the table from 637th in 2022 to number 100 in the space of a year.</p>



<p>For girls, some recent novel entries are Nevaeh, Raya, Hazel and Lilah.</p>



<p>Seasonal names were spotted becoming increasingly popular with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/summer/page/2/">Summer</a> and Autumn both appearing in the top 100, especially during their respective time of year.</p>



<p>However <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/page/3/">Winter</a> remains at number 297, with only 147 baby Winters being born in 2023.</p>



<p>During the cold months, subtle seasonal names like Holly, Robyn  and Joseph were more likely to become favourites.</p>



<p>In November the most popular name in Poppy which the ONS suggests is linked to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/remembrance-day/">Remembrance Day</a>.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" class="authenticated-iframe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MsXMf/1/" height="800" mobile_height="574" width="100%" frameborder="0" style="height: 800px;"></iframe>

<p>Historically, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/royals/">royal</a> baby names have been hailed as powerful baby names, with thousands of youngsters being named after them each year.</p>



<p>However in 2023 royal names fell in popularity with George dropping down from third to fourth in the rankings and William coming in at 29th.</p>



<p>There were only 15 babies named Meghan and 78 named Catherine.</p>



<p>Alternatively, with the Barbenheimer hype still in full swing, there was a boom in babies being named after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrities/">celebrities</a>.</p>



<p>The ONS revealed a trend showing an increase of names related to actors, pop signers, and reality TV stars.</p>



<p>An additional 215 baby girls were named Margo and Cillian jumped up with an extra 12 Cillians born from April to October alone.</p>



<p>Other celebrity names that have gained traction are Billie, Miley, Kendrick, and Elton.</p>

<p>SARINA WIEGMAN has revealed why England were BANNED from bringing on Lucy Bronze in their friendly win over Switzerland.</p>



<p>The Lionesses treated fans to a 1-0 victory courtesy of an early <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32095764/sarina-wiegman-england-clinton-jess-park-lionesses-switzerland/" rel="">Grace Clinton</a> goal to follow up their 0-0 draw with the <span id="d64f1071-99f2-4b6c-9b65-ee1096e0611c" class="suggested-link">USA</span>.</p>

<p>It was later revealed that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196702/england/">England</a> had failed to include Bronze on their official team list.</p>



<p>Wiegman explained: &#8220;That was the moment where she was not on the list. There had been a mistake, unfortunately, a human mistake.</p>



<p>&#8220;We found out there and we still wanted to bring her on the pitch but unfortunately she couldn&#8217;t go so that was really frustrating, of course the most for herself but, we couldn&#8217;t change it anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the International <span id="b7cb18e1-88f9-48a0-8667-779f78520be7" class="suggested-link">Football</span> Association Board&#8217;s (<a href="https://www.theifab.com/" rel="nofollow">IFAB</a>) laws of the game, &#8220;only the players and substitutes named on the team list may take part in the match upon their arrival&#8221;.</p>



<p>For those who are not named on the team list as a player, substitute or a team official, they are classified as &#8220;an outside agent&#8221;.</p>

<p>Wiegman made ten changes from England&#8217;s stalemate with the US, managed by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/emma-hayes/">Emma Hayes</a>.</p>



<p>And Clinton, 21, repaid her faith with her third international goal in five appearances.</p>

<p>CRISTIANO RONALDO has fired a withering four-word response after Rafael van der Vaart revealed why he never saw the legend naked.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>, 39, and the 41-year-old were Real Madrid team-mates for a year until the now-retired Dutchman joined Tottenham in 2010.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32132222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32132222" style="width: 679px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/real-madrid-reacts-backdropped-teammate-954401213.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=679" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32132222" width="679" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32132222" class="wp-caption-text">Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael van der Vaart spent a year together at Real</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32132237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32132237" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cristiano-ronaldo-al-nassr-celebrates-953179096.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32132237" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32132237" class="wp-caption-text">Ronaldo is the hardest worker Van der Vaart has ever played with</figcaption></figure>

<p>But that was enough for the former <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196656/manchester-united/">Manchester United</a> frontman to make a huge impression on the ex-midfielder &#8211; due to his undying work ethic.</p>



<p>CR7&#8217;s passion has led him to five Ballon d&#8217;Or awards and five Champions League titles amid a 22-year career that&#8217;s now led him to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/23509439/al-nassr/">Al-Nassr</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/rafael-van-der-vaart/">Van der Vaart</a> is not surprised as he claims Ronaldo was constantly on the Real training pitch.</p>



<p>So much so that the former playmaker never saw <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a> in the dressing room.</p>



<p>Van der Vaart told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/2350592/rafael-van-der-vaart-cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid-hardest-worker/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">talkSPORT&#8217;s &#8216;The LineUp</a>: &#8220;He never left his house!</p>



<p>&#8220;I always say as a joke, Ronaldo is the only player that I never saw his willy!</p>



<p>&#8220;He was the first one on the training [pitch]! And the last one who went.</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all his body, wow! A machine. He was a little bit ahead of his time, players now are the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;But his training in the gym, food, sleep. For him that was more important than training extra hard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ronaldo was so unbelievably selfish, if we won 6-0 and he did not score, he was not happy. When we lose but he scored twice, it&#8217;d be alright!&#8221;</p>

<p>Van der Vaart never won anything with Ronaldo, who conquered his first of many pieces of silverware with Real in 2010 by claiming the Copa del Rey.</p>



<p>And the Portugal icon replied to VDV&#8217;s comments in a brutally short manner.</p>



<p>Van der Vaart&#8217;s quirky quotes were shared on a Portuguese Instagram account.</p>



<p>And with Ronaldo seemingly spotting the post, he chipped in with: &#8220;Who is this guy?&#8221;  </p>



<p>Perhaps, as Ron sees it, that&#8217;s the harsh naked truth!</p>

<p>BUTLIN&#8217;S has launched a discount for families after I&#8217;m a Celebrity&#8217;s Coleen Rooney raved about her budget break at the holiday resort. </p>



<p>The media personality, 38, is currently competing in the popular <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a> reality show.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32131668" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131668" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/dh0tny-entrance-sign-butlins-skegness-657705285.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131668" width="960" height="641" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131668" class="wp-caption-text">Coleen Rooney raved about her family holiday to Butlin&#8217;s Skegness</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32131608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131608" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coleen-rooney-im-celebrity-get-954510823.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131608" width="960" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131608" class="wp-caption-text">The media personality, 38, is currently competing in the popular ITV reality show</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a conversation with her fellow campsites on Monday night, she said: &#8220;It kept coming on the TV, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/butlins/">Butlins</a>, Butlins. So I went and it was Diversity that was on, it was the May half term I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>She revealed how her son Kai &#8220;loved it so much&#8221; after returning to school from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/holidays/">holidays</a>, he described it as the &#8220;best holiday I&#8217;ve ever been on&#8221; to his teacher. </p>



<p>Since Coleen raved about her family holiday to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/29128405/butlins-reopen-attraction-pool-resort-closed/" rel="">Butlin&#8217;s Skegness</a>, <span id="c3895173-c491-467a-9eda-e37e179cf47e" class="suggested-link">the holiday</span> resort has seen a reported sales boost of 80 per cent. </p>



<p>Holidaymakers who&#8217;ve been inspired by Coleen &#8211; and looking to book their own break to Butin&#8217;s &#8211; can use the code ROO10 for a 10 per cent discount. </p>



<p>The code is valid for breaks happening in 2025</p>



<p>Holidaymakers have until December 8, 2024, to book their break with the discount code. </p>



<p>A spokesperson from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32067514/coleen-rooney-surprising-budget-holidays-iac-reveal/" rel="">Butlin’s</a> said: &#8220;We are delighted to hear about how much Coleen and the boys loved their trip to Butlin’s. </p>



<p>&#8220;We <span id="0f056351-e1b4-4c2a-ad74-100235c80291" class="suggested-link">pride</span> ourselves on being the ultimate destination for family fun and it’s fantastic to receive such brilliant feedback.</p>



<p>&#8220;As such, we’ve launched a special Rooney inspired discount, but don’t take our word for it, take Kai’s. </p>



<p>&#8220;It really will be the best holiday ever so make the most of a special 10% off with any family bookings for 2025.&#8221;</p>

			<div>
<p>TRAVEL writer Catherine Lofthouse has been visiting the Butlin&#8217;s parks for 40 years &#8211; here&#8217;s her verdict:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was little, my family would head to Butlin&#8217;s every July for a week by the sea, and I even worked at the Minehead resort as a lifeguard in my teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that&#8217;s always set Butlin&#8217;s apart from its rivals are the photo opportunities that you have during your break, including Teletubbies and TV star Stephen Mulhern.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/25017821/butlins-how-changed-decades/#"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s also lots of sports and activities to choose from, like football, archery, crafts and soft play.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things I miss from holidays gone by are the monorails that ran at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/21381121/northern-seaside-town-las-vegas/">Skegness&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/17423155/butlins-minehead-vintage-pictures-1960-princess-margaret/">Minehead from the 1960s&nbsp;</a>for forty years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/20351098/im-butlins-dancer-heres-what-its-like-behind-scenes/">&nbsp;Butlin&#8217;s&nbsp;</a>lost its way a bit in the 2000s when it seemed to become a mecca for stag and hen dos, but in the last decade, there&#8217;s been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/5892729/butlins-uk-holiday-review/">a bit of a turnaround&nbsp;</a>in terms of rebranding and investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that anyone who hasn&#8217;t been for a while or who has written Butlin&#8217;s off as not for them might be wise to give it another go.&#8221;</p>

<p>HELLO campers, guess who&#8217;s back? </p>



<p>So no vote off <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity/">last night</a> and they&#8217;re really losing the momentum, particularly because there&#8217;s literally no grief in the camp.</p>

<p>It just seems like a series of insect infected challenges, and<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32122993/shock-twist-im-a-celeb-two-stars-booted-off/"> the vote off has added drama</a> which is something this series has definitely, definitely lacked.</p>



<p>I’m A Celeb, stop messing with the format.</p>



<p>The final four has always been chosen by the public, and the public don&#8217;t seem to be too happy with this new twist to win a fast track Golden Pass to the Cyclone.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s too many people now that are saying this show has definitely been fixed, but who knows?</p>



<p>And did the teams pick their own individual booths, or were they allocated? I&#8217;m not buying into this, and you know, neither are many others.</p>



<p>Oh, Maura&#8217;s screaming of Celine Dion numbers. Barry and Alan were really teasing her about that, weren&#8217;t they?</p>



<p>But she didn&#8217;t look too happy about being ribbed over that one, and I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll get them back.</p>



<p>Then there were Oti’s tears for Melvin as well, it was really sweet, and it really showed her sensitivity and their really close relationship.</p>



<p>Oh and the Rev has lost a lot of weight! You really do though in the jungle, although I am quite surprised given the amount of food everyone seems to have had in this year&#8217;s show.</p>

<p>And actually when you come out of the jungle they check your weight and stats and then inform you of what you should and shouldn&#8217;t eat.</p>



<p>But no one listens, and everyone regrets coming out and stuffing their faces.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s kind of the little things you take for granted in there, like food with actual flavour.</p>



<p>I was really craving Tim Tams in the jungle, and I hadn&#8217;t even had them before.</p>



<p>And it was crazy because everyone was talking about how good they tasted, and I could actually smell the chocolate.</p>



<p>I feel like the senses do crazy things to you, but I literally ate everything when I came out – pizza, chips, chocolate, the lot, and regretted it soon afterwards.</p>



<p>The bloat and stomach pains were literally up there with some of the worst cramps I think I&#8217;ve ever experienced. It was pretty horrendous.</p>



<p>We’ve also got to talk about the fact that I don’t think the Rev ever went to an arcade when he was a kid. He was hopeless.</p>



<p>Danny and Coleen absolutely did.</p>



<p>Danny and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/bruce-springsteen/">Bruce Springsteen</a>, Lord of the North secret pasty shop owner, who supports Bolton.</p>



<p>And Rev wants to be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kevin-de-bruyne/">Kevin De Bruyne</a>! There are so many different sides to his character. He is so funny.</p>



<p>Then Grace is so humble, and she&#8217;s definitely worth more than that title that she gave herself.</p>



<p>She should be proud of all she&#8217;s achieved and shouldn&#8217;t think so low of herself. It really upset me that bit, actually, because I think she&#8217;s amazing.</p>



<p>Then there was Alan and Maura versus Barry and Oti. Their challenge seemed a lot easier.</p>



<p>Well, apart from Barry who could not get tickets into the ticket hole.</p>



<p>Maura and Oti seemed to absolutely smash this one, but great, they got their three stars.</p>



<p>And Maura, wow, that was good.</p>



<p>‘Think I’ve broken a nail’ is definitely something she would say, and Oti’s determination as a dancer was so inspiring. She&#8217;s such a determined person and I love her.</p>



<p>And GK and Danny <span id="5959ea41-b720-43c6-bdf3-5594495d6f6f" class="suggested-link">cooking</span>, well Granny&#8217;s Kitchen has certainly been renamed. </p>



<p>The campmates always know when Ant and Dec are coming in, because you are literally told through the speakers to go and gather around the campfire.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve had a few people message me asking about certain things about jungle life.</p>



<p>Everyone has different contracts, so I&#8217;ve seen people ask whether people wear makeup in there.</p>



<p>Normally, you&#8217;re not allowed to take certain things in there like mascara, or foundation or anything like that, or <span id="3273eb14-2cfc-4f31-88c6-bad65778e211" class="suggested-link">skincare</span>.</p>



<p>But again, everyone&#8217;s contracts are different, and it depends what&#8217;s being negotiated in it.</p>



<p>Some people are allowed to take in makeup, if they specifically request it.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone had skin care in there when we did ours, but it is really interesting because there&#8217;s not one contract.</p>



<p>And it depends how the agents negotiate things for people. So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens.</p>



<p>A few people look shocked to be in the semi-final, that&#8217;s for sure, but someone definitely looked a bit smug and not surprised.</p>



<p>Hmm.</p>



<p>Well, looking forward to watching tonight&#8217;s show to see who ends up in the final.</p>



<p>But I don&#8217;t agree with the way they&#8217;ve formatted it. I think it should be the public that decides – that&#8217;s the whole part of the show.</p>



<p>The public gets to choose their winner, it shouldn’t be how someone&#8217;s edited or making someone set up to win, so we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>47SKIN is known for its &#8220;miracle&#8221; ingredients, which are focused on improving acne-prone and scarred skin.</p>



<p>The skincare brand is dropping some serious discounts throughout December.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32064716" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32064716" style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/47skin-bundle.png?strip=all&amp;w=567" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32064716" width="567" height="405" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32064716" class="wp-caption-text">The bundle comes with three 47Skin products</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>47Skin 3 Step Treatment Bundle, £74 (was £82)</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-19 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener sponsored">BUY HERE</a></div>
</div>



<p>Using a unique, science-driven formula to treat angry skin, the brand is a favourite among skincare fans &#8211; particularly its bestselling Treatment Bundle, which has been <a href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" aria-label="reduced from £82 to £74 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">reduced from £82 to £74</a>.</p>



<p>The <a aria-label="Three-Step Treatment bundle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Three-Step Treatment bundle</a> includes a cleanser, a mask and a serum &#8211; designed to be used together for a powerful treatment. </p>



<p>47Skin uses a unique ingredient, Silver Chitoderm, to reduce blemishes and scars &#8211; while working to minimise future breakouts and hydrate the skin.</p>



<p>Silver Chitoderm is a muco-adhesive that captures acne-causing bacteria, while the silver kills 99.9% of it.</p>



<p>The powerful formula also encourages skin cells to regenerate at a faster speed, working to increase the healing time of spots and scars. </p>



<p>Each product inside the gift set has its own function for improving problem skin. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32072564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32072564" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/47-skin-before-after-z.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32072564" width="960" height="720" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32072564" class="wp-caption-text">47Skin fans have been sharing their skincare journey since using the products</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 47Skin Cleanser should be used first in your daily routine, and the product works to remove impurities both on the surface and within the skin, while unclogging pores.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/beauty-deals/">Beauty</a> fans are advised to follow with the Silver Mask, which can be applied for 20 minutes either twice weekly or whenever a breakout is coming on. </p>



<p>Enriched with a concentrated dose of the brand&#8217;s signature Silver Chitoderm, the mask works to minimise inflammation and scarring.</p>



<p>It reduces spots without being too harsh on the skin.</p>



<p>The final step in the routine is the Anti-Blemish Serum, created to prevent future breakouts by forming a protective layer on the skin that renews the cells.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" aria-label="The three-piece set (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">The three-piece set</a> is perfect for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-gifts/">Christmas gifting,</a> and whether you&#8217;re treating a loved one or yourself to a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/skincare/">skincare</a> upgrade, the sale is the ideal time to save on bestsellers.</p>



<p>The bundle has received impressive reviews on the 47Skin website, with an average Trust Pilot rating of 4.9-out-of-five. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32071990" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32071990" style="width: 593px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/47-skin-set-z.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=593" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32071990" width="593" height="445" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32071990" class="wp-caption-text">The 47Skin set would make the perfect Christmas gift</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">One shopper wrote: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe how quickly it worked, I use the cleanser morning and evening along with the scar serum, and the mask is like a little safety blanket if I feel a spot about to grow.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can honestly say, it&#8217;s really worked. The scars have faded so much, I am so happy.</p>



<p>&#8220;All the expensive facial treatments I&#8217;ve had to help my skin didn&#8217;t come close to what 47Skin has done &#8211; I wish I found it ages ago.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <a aria-label="Skincare Bundle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://go.linkby.com/TDQZOTYB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Treatment Bundle</a> is one is one of the many products that 47Skin shoppers can save on throughout December &#8211; and it&#8217;s a worthy choice for those looking to work on their skincare journey this winter.</p>

<p>It seems right that during this season of giving, Prime Gaming is giving away a massive 18 free games, including a number of popular titles.</p>



<p>Out now are two games from big-name franchises: <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> Bounty Hunter and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider</a> Underworld.</p>



<p>Quake 2 is also available for free right now, and is often considered one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p>However, some of the best games available via Prime Gaming this month are some indie gems.</p>



<p>Overcooked 2 is a great couch co-op game for family and friends as you battle to create dishes in increasingly complicated kitchens.</p>



<p>Dredge is another excellent indie title, where you play as a fisherman trying to discover the secrets of the strange land you find yourself in.</p>



<p>The final game we want to highlight is Planet of Lana, a 2D platformer that was one of the indie darlings of last year.</p>

<p>THE author of Delay, Deny, Defend refused to speak after the words found scrawled on the bullets used to kill health insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York City on Wednesday echoed his book.</p>



<p>Investigators found the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32114145/united-healthcare-ceo-shot-brian-thompson-nyc-killed/">words “deny,” “depose,” and “defend” </a>inscribed on the assassin&#8217;s live rounds and shell casings found at the murder scene in Manhattan.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32127261/secret-meaning-message-bullets-assassin-brian-thompson/">three-word message</a> is strikingly similar to a book about insurance companies published in 2010 by insurance law expert Jay M. Feinman, a professor at Rutgers Law School.</p>



<p>His book Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don&#8217;t Pay Claim and What You Can Do About is fiercely critical of the insurance industry.</p>



<p>Asked by the Sun about any potential link to Wednesday&#8217;s horror shooting, the author replied, &#8220;No comment, sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>A description of the book states that it contains &#8220;dozens of stories involving major insurers&#8221; and aims to counsel readers &#8220;on how to make insurance buying decisions and pursue disputed claims.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was killed when the gunman approached him and opened fire outside the New York Hilton Midtown <span style=", sans-serif;font-size: 18px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;text-indent: 0px;text-transform: none;float: none">just after 6:45 am.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32114145/united-healthcare-ceo-shot-brian-thompson-nyc-killed/">Chilling security footage </a>obtained by The U.S. Sun shows the moment the masked suspect gunned down the CEO.</p>



<p>Thompson did not have security with him at the time despite UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, having an in-house security team.</p>



<p>The suspect was dressed in a dark, hooded jacket with a mask pulled up over his nose and was carrying a grey backpack.</p>



<p>Following the killing, <span>the shooter</span> calmly got on a nearby e-bike and rode into Central Park. He was last seen on Central Park Drive.</p>



<p>Cops have launched a desperate manhunt for the gunman, who remains at large, using drones, helicopters, and <span id="85e53419-a349-4d00-86cd-12e39176ea56" class="suggested-link">dogs</span>.</p>

<p>The suspect was caught on security cameras ordering at Starbucks on West 56th and 6th Avenue<span style=", serif;font-size: 19px;font-style: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;text-indent: 0px;text-transform: none;float: none">&nbsp;</span>just two blocks from the scene before the shooting.</p>



<p>Sources claimed he bought coffee, a water bottle, and two PowerBars before the shooting.</p>



<p>He tossed the bottle and coffee cup in a trash can &#8211; which cops dug out of the garbage and now have as evidence.</p>



<p>Investigators also found a phone in an alley near the scene that they believe belongs to the gunman.</p>

			<div>
<p>UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in a brazen attack on December 4 as he was leaving a New York City hotel. Parent company UnitedHealth Group released the following statement:</p>
<p>“We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.”</p>

<p>Thompson had been in <span id="5da8e056-f219-4e54-9b20-d48ebe182caf" class="suggested-link">New York City</span> since Monday, and detectives are investigating how the shooter was able to track his movements.</p>



<p>However, it was public knowledge that he would host the event, and he was expected to announce that the company was looking forward to a profitable 2025.</p>



<p>Thompson was appointed CEO of UnitedHealthcare in April 2021.</p>



<p>Before becoming CEO, Thompson held various leadership roles within UnitedHealth Group, including positions in finance and operations.</p>



<p>Thompson was one of the senior executives at the company investigated by the Department of Justice.</p>

			<h3 class="article-boxout__headline">5 ways to keep your house warm in winter </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					Property expert Joshua Houston shared his tips. 				</p>

			<div>
<p><strong>1. Curtains </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Windows are a common place for the outside cold to get into your home, this is because of small gaps that can let in air so always close your curtains as soon as it gets dark,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>This simple method gives you an extra layer of warmth as it can provide a kind of &#8220;insulation&#8221; between your window and curtain.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rugs </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Your floor is another area of your home where heat can be lost and can make your home feel chilly,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;You might notice on cold days, that your floor is not nice to walk on due to it freezing your feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Add rugs to areas that don’t already have a carpet, this provides a layer of insulation between your bare floor and the room above.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Check your insulation </strong></p>
<p>Check your pipes, loft space, crawlspaces and underneath floorboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loose-fill insulation is very good for this, and is a more affordable type of insulation, with a big bag being able to be picked up for around £30,&#8221; Joshua explained.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep your internal doors closed </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Household members often gather in one room in the evening, and this is usually either the kitchen or living room,&#8221; Joshua said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This means you only have to heat a small area of your home, and closing the doors keeps the heat in and the cold out.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Block drafts </strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check cat flaps, chimneys and letterboxes, as they can let in cold air if they aren&#8217;t secure.</p>
</div>
		</div>

<p>The mid grey and natural colours are currently out of stock online, but the black and dark navy are available to order, both of which are available with free delivery and extended <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas/" rel="">Christmas</a> returns until 5th January. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/shopping/" rel="">Shoppers</a> flocked to the Debenhams website to share their glowing reviews of the heated throw, with many praising its &#8216;fluffy and warm’ feel.</p>



	<!--googleoff: all-->
	<blockquote class="article__quote">
		<div class="article__quote-copy theme__before-color theme__after-color">

<ul>
<li>USB gloves &#8211; initial cost £10, cost to run less than 1p an hour</li>
<li>Heated insoles &#8211; initial cost £10, cost to run less than 1p an hour</li>
<li>USB hand warmers &#8211; initial cost £15, cost to run less than 1p an hour</li>
<li>Electric gilet &#8211; initial cost £50 (including battery pack), cost to run  less than 1p an hour</li>
<li>Microwaveable wheat bag &#8211; initial cost £4, cost to run less than 1p per hours</li>
<li>Reusable hand warmers &#8211; initial cost £5 for a pair, cost to run less than 1p per hour</li>

<p>&#8220;We chose the blue and it&#8217;s beautiful, looks really expensive, will make a lovely gift.</p>



<p>“Perfect for an older relative for a bit of extra warmth this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>One customer commented: &#8220;Easy online ordering, good price and very fast delivery. Haven&#8217;t used product yet as it&#8217;s a gift, but I&#8217;m sure the recipient will be pleased.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another shopper who purchased the blanket shared: &#8220;Very happy with my purchase, makes bed warm and toasty.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite this, not all feedback was as positive, as one shopper claimed: “Wire [is] quite short so have to be close to a plug.”</p>

<p>BMW has launched a new &#8220;overhauled&#8221; version of its flagship EV model, boosting a rang-boosting battery update and friction-resistant wheels.</p>



<p>The revised <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/">motor</a> is set to hit showrooms within months and is set to retain a controversial styling feature.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32131883" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131883" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/www-autoexpress-co-uk-bmw-954763144.png?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131883" width="960" height="541" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131883" class="wp-caption-text">BMW has given a first look at the 2025 iX EV</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_32131902" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131902" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/bmw-ix-electric-crossover-suv-954763940.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131902" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131902" class="wp-caption-text">The original iX was controversial for its redesigned grille</figcaption></figure>



<p>Beemer debuted the iX in 2020 after a two-year concept run.</p>



<p>It was only the German brand&#8217;s second fully <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/electric-cars/">electric car</a>, behind 2013&#8217;s  i3.</p>



<p>But the model has sparked much debate among enthusiasts for a radical shakeup of its appearance.</p>



<p>Most notably, fans were divided over the redesign of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/22320043/robins-hatched-radiator-grille-bmw/">BMW&#8217;s iconic grille</a>.</p>



<p>Bosses made the decision to move away from wide and short intakes at the front to a pair of more rectangular ones.</p>



<p>This prompted criticisms from some customers, who complained that the firm had fundamentally changed the character of its cars.</p>



<p>Now, Beemer is introducing a reworked version of the design for the 2025 model year.</p>



<p>Initial teaser pictures show the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/26390457/five-car-models-banned-from-driving-tests/">car in testing</a>, disguised by a camouflage wrap.</p>



<p>There will be some changes to the headlight array and some other minor exterior details.</p>



<p>But the opinion-splitting grille looks to be here to stay.</p>

<p>Under the bodywork, a new battery has been developed for the car, which promises to increase both range and power.</p>



<p>Bosses credit this to a set of &#8216;friction-reducing&#8217; wheels, providing a 10% boost to efficiency, and greater cell capacity.</p>



<p>As with its predecessor, there will be a range of specs available, including an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/31593900/bmw-electric-m3-more-power/">M variant</a> which will boast higher horsepower and s sports braking system, identified by the red calipers on the wheels.</p>



<p>The base model will also see revised suspension, including a new hydraulic rear axle, to improve ride quality.</p>



<p>The new iX is expected to come to the UK in 2025, with a similar £70,000 price tag to the previous generation.</p>

<p>He said it was “altogether more complex” than the Cold War nuclear arms race and post-Cold War decades of disarmament.</p>



<p>He said: “We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age which is altogether more complex.</p>



<p>“It is defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies, and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before.”</p>



<p>He singled out <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/iran/">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/north-korea/">North Korea</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> as looming nuclear threats.</p>



<p>He said: “From <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> we have seen wild threats of tactical nuclear use, large scale nuclear exercises and simulated attacks against <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a> countries, all designed to coerce us from taking the action required to maintain stability.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: “China’s nuclear build up poses a two-peer challenge to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>



<p>“Iran’s failure to cooperate with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) is a concern, and North Korea’s ballistic missile programme and erratic behaviour presents a regional and, increasingly, a global threat.”</p>



<p>The Chief of Defence Staff slammed Vladimir Putin’s “wild” nuclear threats.</p>



<p>But he said the tyrant was under no illusions that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/russia/">Russia</a> would get annihilated in the event of a doomsday strike.</p>



<p>He said: “The UK’s nuclear deterrent is the one part of our inventory of which Russia is most aware and has more impact on Putin than anything else.”</p>

<p>He insisted the risk of a “significant direct attack or invasion by Russia on the United Kingdom” was remote.</p>



<p>He said: “Russia knows the response would be overwhelming, whether conventional or nuclear.”</p>



<p>And he warned “tens of thousands more” may follow as part of a new security pact which sees <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/moscow/">Moscow</a> give Pyongyang “the most sensitive <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/technology/">technology</a> and expertise”.</p>



<p>He said North Korea’s decision to send thousands of troops to Russia was “this year’s most extraordinary development”.</p>

<p>BRITISH driver Abbi Pulling will have to earn the F1 Academy title this weekend&#8230; despite having already been declared the champion.</p>



<p>The bizarre situation comes after some last minute changes to the women-only series.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32131473" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131473" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rodin-motorsport-supported-alpine-tatuus-953464685.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131473" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131473" class="wp-caption-text">Abbi Pulling had been declared champion last weekend</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two races had been scheduled to take place in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/qatar/">Qatar</a> last weekend.</p>



<p>But due to barrier repairs, the second was cancelled.</p>



<p>This meant that Pulling, 21, held an unassailable lead heading into the final races of the season in Abu Dhabi.</p>



<p>It saw the Alpine driver declared champion and she even celebrated her triumph.</p>



<p>But she will now have to earn it again, after organisers decided to add a third race to this weekend&#8217;s schedule in Abu Dhabi.</p>



<p>This late addition means that 84 points are now on offer, which means that Pulling&#8217;s current lead of 83 points is not quite enough to declare her the official champ.</p>



<p>In truth, it would take something astonishing for the Brit to not be champion.</p>



<p>Each race offers 25 points for a win.</p>

<p>A further two are earned for securing pole, while a bonus point is added for fastest lap.</p>



<p>Organisers have confirmed that two points will be declared for securing pole in each of the three races.</p>

<p>This means that 84 points will be available this weekend, with Pulling 83 ahead of closest rival Doriane Pin.</p>



<p>Pin, 20, had earned pole for last weekend&#8217;s second race that never was in Qatar.</p>



<p>Despite the race not going ahead, Pin has retained those two points.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/f1/">Formula One</a> teams each nominate a driver and have their livery on a car in the Academy, a series on their support programme aimed at helping female racers climb the ladder.</p>



<p>The last woman to start an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/f1/">F1</a> Grand Prix was the late Italian Lella Lombardi in 1976.</p>

<p>AN Ecuadorian footballer who was kidnapped close to the Colombian border has been released.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32105218/juventus-pedro-perlaza-kidnap/" rel="">Pedro Perlaza was abducted</a> in the province of Esmeraldas in his native country.</p>

<p>Perlaza&#8217;s family reported him missing on Monday evening, with the alleged abduction taking place at 9am that day.</p>



<p>But it has now been confirmed by local authorities that he has been released along with another individual.</p>



<p>Police posted on X: &#8220;Through its specialised units, it freed citizens Pedro P. and Juan M. in #Esmeraldas [northwest], who were involuntarily missing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Colonel Diego Velastegui, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/" rel="">police</a> chief of the oil port of Esmeralda, said: &#8220;They have been mistreated, but they are alive.&#8221;</p>



<p>Velastegui went on to reveal the rescue operation saw the police &#8220;greeted with bullets by these criminals when they entered the area&#8221;.</p>



<p>He also stated the kidnappers left the scene and are &#8220;presumed injured&#8221;.</p>



<p>Perlaza and the other victim were reunited with their families at the police headquarters in Esmeraldas.</p>



<p>They were barefoot and wearing caps given to them by the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Ecuadorian Police.</p>



<p>It is alleged Perlaza, 33, was intercepted by a motorcyclist while travelling on a road and forced into a vehicle.</p>



<p>He has spent his entire <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/" rel="">football</a> career playing in Ecuador and has won three caps for the national team.</p>



<p>He now plays for Ecuadorian top flight side Delfin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very quickly become my favourite thing to wear ever, and I&#8217;ve hardly taken it off (or put my heating on) since receiving it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love it so much I bought another one within a couple of weeks, as I can&#8217;t be without one when it&#8217;s being washed.&#8221;</p>



<p>A second customer added: &#8220;This is Oodie is so comfortable, cosy and light and I have popped it on every evening when I get home.</p>



<p>&#8220;I now don&#8217;t have to run the heating on some evenings, saving me on heating power bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>A SELF-DESCRIBED catfish has been labelled a &#8220;chav&#8221; by trolls cruelly slamming her love of a Noughties make-up look.</p>



<p>Macy regularly takes to her social media pages to share epic transformation videos while <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/make-up/">dolling </a>herself up for a big night out.</p>

<p>And while she&#8217;s happy to acknowledge she&#8217;s a &#8220;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/catfish">catfish</a>&#8220;, Macy won&#8217;t apologise for her love of a full glam look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Catfish with me as someone who loves 2016 make-up,&#8221; she wrote over the top of her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@macyalexa10/video/7440852384177491246?_r=1&amp;_t=ZG-8rwiDZVOUVN" target="_blank" aria-label="TikTok video.

<p>She began the clip <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/hair-and-beauty/">make-up free</a> &#8211; with her natural freckles on full display &#8211; before covering them completely with cosmetics. </p>



<p>Macy began with hew brows, combing and filling them in, before adding some gel to keep in place. </p>



<p>Next up was foundation, as Macy opted for a full coverage product in a shade or two darker than her natural skintone. </p>



<p>She used a brush to spread the product around her face, before adding a liberal helping of bronzer, and topping off with concealer. </p>



<p>She patted in some blusher before &#8216;baking&#8217; the under-eye area with a loose powder. </p>



<p>Macy then moved onto the eyes, going for a bronzy brown smoky eye, with some gold glitter on the inner eye. </p>



<p>She finished her eyes off with some very large fake lashes, before going over her face with powder bronzer and blusher. </p>



<p>The finishing touch was the lips, and Macy opted to overline her pout with a magenta liner, before filling in with gloss. </p>

<p>Then her transformation was complete, as Macy pouted and posed for the camera &#8211; with her hair in a high ponytail. </p>



<p>&#8220;Full glam&gt;&gt;&gt;clean girl makeup,&#8221; she captioned the video. </p>



<p>But people in the comments section were divided as to whether they liked the finished look or not. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s giving chav,&#8221; one insisted. </p>



<p>&#8220;Now girllll lol no just no, take that off,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your make-up is so muddy babe,&#8221; a third commented. </p>



<p>&#8220;You have such a natural beauty, you should really embrace your freckles!&#8221;</p>



<p>To which another hit back: &#8220;This is so mean &#8211; people can do whatever they want with their make-up!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Send help,&#8221; someone else raged.</p>



<p>&#8220;Overlined your lips way too much,&#8221; another wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;Throws off the whole look and looks like drag make-up.&#8221;</p>



<p>But others insisted they were on board with the make-up look. </p>



<p>&#8220;2016 make-up FOREVER,&#8221; one gushed. </p>



<p>&#8220;Beautiful. 2016 make-up is unmatched,&#8221; another added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love 2016 make-up so what sue me,&#8221; a third commented. </p>



<p>&#8220;I physically cannot do my make-up any other way,&#8221; someone else wrote. </p>



<p>&#8220;Idk why people hate on 2016 make-up. 2016 make-up or no make-up,&#8221; another commented. </p>



<p>&#8220;This!! i’ll always LOVE me a full glam.. glad i’m not alone,&#8221; someone else said. </p>



<p>&#8220;Like what is clean girl, it&#8217;s giving no make-up!!&#8221; Macy replied. </p>



<p>As another added: &#8220;Girl me too you aren’t alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>SAMSUNG has given its first official glimpse of the new Android revamp coming to Galaxy smartphones soon.</p>



<p>The tech giant&#8217;s own version of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/android/" rel="">Android</a>, called One UI, has packed in a load of fresh features for its big seventh release.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32131184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131184" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image005.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131184" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131184" class="wp-caption-text">New Now Bar is similar to iPhone&#8217;s Dynamic Island</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32131190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131190" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image006.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131190" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131190" class="wp-caption-text">The camera app has been revamped too</figcaption></figure>



<p>And although One UI 7 isn&#8217;t widely available yet, you can opt to use it before anyone else as part of a new beta programme available in the UK and US, as well as Germany, India, Korea and Poland from today.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/samsung/">Samsung</a> has developed greater personalisation and control in the free update.</p>



<p>The home screen has been simplified with less visual clutter, along with new look widgets and lock screen changes.</p>



<p>A new notification system has been introduced too, with a Now Bar at the bottom of the screen similar to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/iphone/">iPhone</a>&#8216;s Dynamic Island, which highlights activities from various features like Interpreter, Music, Recording and Stopwatch.</p>



<p>Samsung says the move will reduce the need to constantly unlock your device.</p>



<p>The firm has also boosted its <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/artificial-intelligence/">AI</a> efforts with improvements to the writing assist tools, as well as upgraded call features so conversations are automatically transcribed to refer to later, meaning you no longer need to rush to take notes.</p>



<p>Users will notice a revamp to the camera <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/app/">app</a> too.</p>



<p>Modes have been reorganised to make it easier to find the features you need and to give you a clearer preview of the picture you’re taking or the video you&#8217;re recording.</p>



<p>Samsung&#8217;s security features have been enhanced with theft protection, auto Blocker and more.</p>



<p>Galaxy users can now take advantage of additional security measures in Identity Check, an opt-in feature designed for when a device’s PIN becomes compromised.</p>

<p>In 2019, Fallon became the first woman to beat a man at the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/20189023/world-darts-champion-andy-fordham-celebration/">BDO World Darts Championship</a>, defeating <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10574764/fallon-sherrock-darts-ted-evetts/">Ted Evetts 3-2</a></span>, going on to beat 11th seed <span class="s1">Mensur Suljović in the second round — before losing to 22nd seed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5142362/phil-taylor-chris-dobey-pdc-world-championship/">Chris Dobey</a> in round three.</span></p>
<p>Since then she has become a real threat on the men&#8217;s circuit, reaching the final of the Nordic Darts Masters in September 2021.</p>
<p>Fallon made history yet again in August 2023 when she became the first <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/23662385/fallon-sherrocks-darts-nine-darter-scorer/">woman to make a televised nine-dart finish</a> against Adam Lipscombe in the Modus Super Series.</p>
<p>And she is not the only Sherrock on the darts scene, with twin sister Felicia having competed alongside her at the WDF Europe Cup Youth in 2011.</p>

<p>He is a 35-year-old darts player, who was born in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/glasgow/">Glasgow</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/scotland/">Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>Cameron also works a plumber and fits his day-job around competing in top-level darts tournaments.</p>
<p>He said he&#8217;s lucky to have a partner he can practice darts with at home&#8230; that is until he gets beat.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cameron</span> told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/darts/news/12288/12770796/world-darts-championship-fallon-sherrocks-partner-cameron-menzies-says-he-is-proud-of-what-she-has-done#:~:text=Cameron%20Menzies%20and%20Fallon%20Sherrock,Darts%20%2D%20on%20Tuesday%20from%207pm">Sky Sports:</a> &#8220;We enjoy our practice together and she is a very class player.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has done well for darts in general and is banging in 90 averages and 100 averages, the same as a lot of women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite lucky I&#8217;ve got a very good partner who can play darts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good in the house unless she beats me and I&#8217;ve got to make the food. I don&#8217;t like it when she beats me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will support her left, right and centre. I am her biggest fan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might be a bit strict, but I know how good she is. I&#8217;ve known her for a very long time and I know she is very, very good.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s taken me places I would never have experienced because of darts, so I&#8217;m a very lucky person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m her biggest fan and I wish her all the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Menzies is ranked 41 in the world in PDC Order of Merit.</p>

<h2>Relationship timeline</h2>
<p>Fallon and Cameron met on the darts circuit and clicked in no time — they played doubles together and naturally got together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31228400/fallon-sherrock-cameron-menzies-romance-kfc/">The couple started dating in 2021</a> — their romance blossomed after a date at a KFC in Southampton.</p>
<p>A year later they moved in together, with some higher-class date nights following, such as dining at one of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/salt-bae/">Salt Bae&#8217;s</a> restaurants.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Scot revealed his girlfriend has improved his darts.</p>
<p>Time away from his day job <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/25064909/darts-pdc-world-championships-plumbing-cameron-menzies/">as a plumber</a> has also made him a better player, with Fallon cheering him on when she&#8217;s not playing herself.</p>
<p>Menzies revealed: &#8220;I had known Fallon for years in darts and played doubles with her years ago.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 959px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-11.04.28.png?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="Scot Menzies revealed Sherrock is better at bigger tournaments than him" width="959" height="602" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cameron admitted Fallon is better than him on the big stage at majors</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>&#8220;We met in an online league in Southampton. The rest is history as they say. It started off with a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/kfc/">KFC</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amusingly, in an interview with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/11657047/rangers-fallon-sherrock-darts-cameron-menzies-girlfriend-prince-william/">The Scottish Sun</a> Menzies revealed that Sherrock has &#8220;bigger balls&#8221; than him and is better when the pressure is on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t with Fallon I&#8217;d still be a decent darts player, but she has definitely made me a better player. Who is the better of the two of us?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I’m a tad better, but she’s better on stage when you&#8217;re in the spotlight. She just handles that better&#8230; she has bigger balls than me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m getting better at it, but when it comes down to the marbles in an important match<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10576689/fallon-sherrock-darts-next-match-pdc-healh-scare/"> Fallon</a> performs better. Hopefully one day I can keep up with her level in that area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron is always looking at the draws at the Worlds, and is hopeful of avoiding his partner.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DARTS-World-20345160jpg-JS866539877-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="The feeling is mutual - with Sherrock regularly cheering on Menzies from the crowd" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fallon can be found regularly cheering Cameron on</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a handful of players you don&#8217;t want to draw and Fallon is up there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I play Fallon in the house and I beat her eight times out of 10, but she has a moment when she smashes me.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Did Fallon have a health scare?</h2>
<p>Just months after giving birth to her son Rory, Fallon developed a serious kidney problem that almost led to organ failure.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10566579/fallon-sherrock-pdc-world-darts-evetts-organ-failure-suljovic/">SunSport&#8217;s Rob Maul</a>, she said: &#8220;About six months after I had my little boy in April 2014, I ended up getting a kidney disease.</p>
<div class="advert-wrapper advert-wrapper--outstream">
<div id="outstream" class="dfp-ad advert--outstream">&#8220;I started to feel unwell. I didn’t know what was going on until I was diagnosed.</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It was a worrying time. I started taking medication to weaken my immune system because that is what was attacking my kidneys.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 875px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/msemail_fsherrock_420886607_721700683392744_6641490847768523296_njpg-JS942837056.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=875" alt="Sherrock and Menzies enjoyed a trip to Las Vegas earlier this year" width="875" height="702" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The couple enjoyed a holiday to Las Vegas in 2024</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>&#8220;The problem was when I went on different medication, I suffered side effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the side effects caused ‘moon face’, where my face swelled up. It was a reaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I played in the BDO worlds on TV, I received a lot of criticism for how I looked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I saw negative comments I tried to look past them. I’m not going to dwell on what someone has said if it doesn’t affect my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that attitude helps to strengthen my character.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Will she play at the PDC World Darts Championship this year?</h2>
<p>Yeas, Fallon will be competing in the 2024-25 <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/24873668/world-darts-championship-draw-mistake-sky-sports/">PDC World Championship</a>, much to the delight of her army of fans.</p>

<p>FERRARI have been urged to tear up Lewis Hamilton&#8217;s mega-money contract after the Brit made a &#8220;worrying&#8221; admission.</p>



<p>It has been a season to forget for Hamilton as he has struggled to bring the best out of his car in his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32117499/lewis-hamilton-leaving-mercedes-record-breaking-11-years/" rel="">final year with Mercedes.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/lewis-hamilton/" rel="">Hamilton</a>, 39, is due to switch to childhood heroes <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> next season, as Carlo Sainz heads to Williams.</p>



<p>But last week, he was called out for making a &#8220;worrying&#8221; comment ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix.</p>



<p>Hamilton said after sprint qualifying: &#8220;The positive is that the car is fast and George should be able to shoot for pole tomorrow. </p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows? I’m definitely not fast anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ex-F1 team owner <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/26221455/eddie-jordan-attack-christian-horner-sexting/" rel="">Eddie Jordan</a> has now advised the Italian team to tear up Hamilton&#8217;s contract in light of his admission.</p>



<p>Jordan told the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/formula-for-success/id1674239951" target="_blank" aria-label="Formula For Success Podcast: (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Formula For Success Podcast:</a> &#8220;If you don’t believe 100 per cent, you’re f****d. Do you understand that? </p>



<p>&#8220;Because belief, 99.9 per cent means that there is that tiny, little, little thing in there knocking on your head that gives you the things that maybe, oh, I don’t really have that confidence. </p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t really have the ability. And at the moment what I heard from Lewis, I’m not fast enough anymore, they were the words, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/betting/20574123/best-football-betting-sites/" target="_blank" aria-label="BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER</strong>S</a></p>



<p>He added: &#8220;Honestly, if I was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>, I would say close the book, find the way out. That’s it. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think also, if it’s a little message to you, Lewis, if you’re out there, always remember in life. You’ve got your music, you’ve got your fashion, you’ve got all sorts of other things.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, in most people’s view, the greatest driver of all time. Please remember what I’m going to say to you. Always, always think about the best exit. And this is the time to take the money off the table. Go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former F1 star <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/16467966/david-coulthard-f1-car-collection/" rel="">David Coulthard</a> also found Hamilton&#8217;s uncharacteristic admission troublesome.</p>



<p>Coulthard said: &#8220;He’s as low as he can be right now. But I would say that’s pretty worrying.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn’t detract from his brilliance, it doesn’t take away anything from the records, but there is a thing called mother nature and the clock is ticking.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hamilton holds the all-time <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/f1/">F1</a> record for pole positions but has been beaten over one lap by team-mate <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/george-russell/">George Russell</a> 20 times this season.</p>



<p>And it has raised questions about his competitive edge as he looks towards teaming up with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/charles-leclerc/">Charles Leclerc</a> at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ferrari/">Ferrari</a>.</p>



<p>The Brit did manage to win two races, at Silvertone and in Belgium earlier this term but sits seventh in the driver&#8217;s standings.</p>



<p>The seven-time champ activated a release clause in his Mercedes contract to join Ferrari in a &#8220;multi-year&#8221; deal that is reportedly worth £78million per year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/russia/">RUSSIA</a> has suffered its bloodiest month yet in its war with Ukraine, with almost 46,000 troops lost to Putin’s relentless meatgrinder.</p>



<p>Russian soldiers were being slaughtered and wounded at an average daily rate of 1,523 in November, according to UK intelligence services.</p>

<p>November also saw the most damaging single day for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/russia/">Russia</a>, with 2,030 losses on November 28.</p>



<p>This was the first time more than 2,000 Russian losses were recorded in a single day.</p>



<p>A war loss means a soldier has been killed or seriously wounded and put out of action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>November marked the fifth month in a row that the grim record for losses has been broken, and the figure was a considerable increase on October’s total of almost 42,000.</p>



<p>But heartless Vlad is seemingly indifferent to the colossal pain he is inflicting on his people. </p>



<p>Rather than pulling back or even holding the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/frontline/">frontline</a>, he is pushing forward on multiple fronts, including Kursk, Kupiansk and Toretsk, in an attempt to snatch more land.</p>



<p>His <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/army/">army</a>&#8216;s advances in these areas are gradual and come at a huge cost to the Russian people.</p>



<p>The bloodthirsty maniac is also planning new offensives in two more directions, in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. </p>



<p>He evidently believes his crazed obsession with expanding his domain is worth the sickening <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/bbc-casualty/">casualty</a> rate.</p>



<p>There are no signs Vlad intends to let up; the UK’s Defence Intelligence expects Russia’s casualty rate to remain above 1,000 per day through December 2024, despite the onset of <span id="3c226046-9da8-4d39-8f61-1898191da8df" class="suggested-link">winter</span>.</p>

<p>Whilst <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> is losing ground on multiple fronts, its forces have continued to hold parts of the Kursk region they took in August.</p>



<p>Experts predict that <span id="3bad7e59-25fc-45c0-bf07-96fc0cbfe9ff" class="suggested-link">Ukraine</span> will retain a defensive mentality over winter, at least until Donald Trump’s inauguration in January when the picture will become clearer.</p>



<p>When Trump enters the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/white-house/">White House</a>, he will deploy <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32104116/trump-plan-peace-ukraine-war-russia-putin-zelenksy/">a plan being worked on</a> behind the scenes that he hopes will end the war in <span id="b8b0f91c-2d9f-4a52-9c3b-6e7a59aae79b" class="suggested-link">Ukraine</span> within a matter of days.</p>



<p>He regularly promised to bring peace to the region “within 24 hours” during the election campaign this year.</p>



<p>Details of the plan have been emerging, including Trump’s intention to use military support for Ukraine as a “carrot and stick” tool to bring the warring leaders to the discussion table.</p>



<p>If the Russian warmonger kept snatching land and refused to join peace talks, Trump would make him suffer by pouring more cash into Ukraine’s military.</p>



<p>Zelensky would be rewarded for following Trump’s lead with support for Ukraine to protect itself under the new terms of any deal.</p>



<p>Under Trump’s plan, Zelensky would have to give up the land <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/russia/">Russia</a> has already taken in the eastern regions of Ukraine and drop his dream of immediately joining <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nato/">Nato</a>.</p>



<p>Insiders close to Trump told The Sun that Putin is “scared to death” of the president-elect and will be ready to talk when he takes <span id="e819f020-6c4a-4839-9b89-8fe316284d9c" class="suggested-link">power</span>.</p>



<p>But, because <span id="712bcdfe-7862-4a30-aed3-14c3a1424d6b" class="suggested-link">Russia</span> is making gradual land advances at the moment, some also fear that Putin will drag his heels in order to grab every inch of territory he can.</p>

<p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED icon Kath Phipps has passed away aged 85.</strong></p>



<p>Kath had worked at the club since the 1960s in a variety of roles including as a receptionist and telephone switchboard operator, and was a hugely popular figure.</p>

<figure id="attachment_32131767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131767" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/564bdec2-a0a3-408f-9a3a-a048e9dc6d2e.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131767" width="960" height="686" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131767" class="wp-caption-text">Kath worked for United for 55 years and joined when Sir Matt Busby was manager</figcaption></figure>

<p>United expressed their &#8220;sadness&#8221; and &#8220;heartbreak&#8221; at Kath&#8217;s passing, and tributes have poured in from fans.</p>



<p>A statement read: &#8220;We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of our beloved colleague Kath Phipps at the age of 85.</p>



<p>&#8220;An omnipresent figure at <span id="7b5d2fc9-d462-44f2-8175-a4ebb83f472e" class="suggested-link">Manchester</span> United since the late 1960s, Kath worked for the club for over 55 years in a variety of roles, but her contribution went beyond any particular job title.</p>



<p>&#8220;Having become a key member of the club’s office staff in the ensuing years, Kath later became a matchday fixture at Old Trafford’s directors’ entrance and took on the role of training ground receptionist, ensuring that any visitor to Carrington was greeted by the cheeriest of welcomes. </p>



<p>&#8220;For regulars, that greeting would extend to warm hugs and friendly chats as Kath came to embody the familial atmosphere underpinning the club&#8217;s culture.</p>



<p>&#8220;If Kath ever had a bad day, she never brought it to work; her positive attitude helped set the mood for everyone entering the training ground, always ready to lend an ear and offer words of encouragement to anyone who needed them – be they megastar footballers, casual staff or occasional visitors.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kath was a one-woman institution, whose memory will be cherished by everyone at the club who had the privilege of knowing her. She said last year: “I can’t imagine doing anything else.” Well, we can’t imagine the place without her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rest in peace, Kath.&#8221;</p>



<p>Last year the club paid tribute to Kath with a feature about her life and career, in which they described her as the &#8220;heartbeat of United&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kath&#8217;s first role at the club was as a telephone switchboard operator, in 1968 when Sir Matt Busby was in charge.</p>

<p>Fast forward 18 years and she was one of the first members of staff to welcome <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/sir-alex-ferguson/" rel="">Sir <span id="69132855-2d6e-4c85-b835-dec807930769" class="suggested-link">Alex Ferguson</span></a> to the club, and he later moved her over from <span id="92a0c629-9e67-48c7-bfe6-dfb3febf3c41" class="suggested-link">Old Trafford</span> to Carrington.</p>



<p>Kath also built a bond with the players and even appeared in <span id="05cd604c-33a2-4610-baaf-943a5d719252" class="suggested-link">Netflix</span>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a> <span id="675162dd-b6b5-44b1-a820-b1ffae710c49" class="suggested-link">documentary</span>.</p>



<p>In May 2022 Kath was honoured with a Service to <span id="d7fd9d7f-4ec6-427d-9b77-d8c07c5fc82d" class="suggested-link">Football</span> Award &#8211; Beckham paid tribute to her afterwards saying the &#8220;amazing&#8221; receptionist &#8220;really deserved&#8221; the accolade &#8220;for her services to <span id="79eea13d-af5c-4e96-b1b8-0c95cf0ff51c" class="suggested-link">football</span>, but more importantly for services to the club I love and you love&#8221;.</p>



<p>He said she used to be &#8220;the first person I would see when I walked into the training ground reception&#8221; and he would be &#8220;forever grateful to her&#8221; for dealing with letters from his fans.</p>



<p>Ferguson said she was &#8220;and continues to be a great servant to the club&#8221; and the award was &#8220;thoroughly deserved&#8221;.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/wayne-rooney/">Wayne Rooney</a> lead the tributes to Kath, saying: &#8220;The heart and soul of Man Utd. Everything what the club is about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest in peace Kath, we love you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former Red Devils skipper <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harry-maguire/">Harry Maguire</a> said: &#8220;A legend that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>The 2024-25 Formula E season is ready to burn rubber once more as teams and drivers prepare for the new season to get underway. </strong></p>



<p>Formula E is paving the way for the future with radical cars, all powered by electricity. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>



<p>In the simplest terms,<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/formula-e/"> Formula E</a> is an international car racing championship that uses electric cars instead of traditional petrol-powered vehicles.</p>



<p>There are 11 teams, all of which have two cars and two drivers, operating single seater cars similar in appearance to those in F1. </p>



<p>This season, the 11th since it started, consists of 16 races in 10 countries from Sao Paulo to Shanghai and Miami to Monaco.</p>



<p>Drivers and teams score points according to where they finish in each race, and the aim is to finish the season with the highest points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current season starts on December 7 in Sao Paulo and finishes in July in London, a race that the likes of Cara Delevingne have attended in the past. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT SPEED DOES A FORMULA E CAR GO?</h2>



<p>The batteries in the current generation of Formula E cars can deliver up to 350kW of power and can propel a driver to a maximum top speed of 199mph, which is close to the top speed of traditional cars.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN F1 AND FE?</h2>



<p>The noise levels are the first real contrast, with almost nobody in the crowd wearing earplugs as they might in Formula One.</p>



<p>When the cars zip around the track they sound no louder than electric toothbrushes.</p>



<p>During Formula E races, the scoreboard shows the cars’ energy levels, and a crucial aspect of strategy is based on battery conservation. </p>



<p>There are typically no pit stops, because the drivers don’t change tyres, for the sake of sustainability.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of crashes, just not fiery ones due to the lack of fuel.</p>



<p>Compared to F1 the races are shorter and the crowds are smaller, but the rise is inevitable. </p>



<p>The racing is also closely contested due to the rules, with Formula E drivers moving back and fourth in the pack far more than F1 drivers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ONES TO WATCH&nbsp;</h2>



<p>German-Mauritian driver Pascal Wehrlein won his maiden Formula E title last season with TAG Heuer Porsche looking to defend his crown this term.</p>



<p>The ex-Formula 1 driver has spent six seasons in Formula E, first joining the grid with Mahindra before moving to Porsche for the start of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>



<p>Prior to this season, Wehrlein had taken four wins with the German manufacturer which included a title tilt two-seasons ago before eventually finishing fourth in the standings.</p>



<p>He was once a member of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/31496977/lewis-hamilton-hints-quit-mercedes-f1-worst-car/">Mercedes</a> junior team but was thrust onto the F1 scene with Manor in 2016, making his debut at the Australian Grand Prix and scoring their only Championship point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He then moved to Sauber in 2017 and despite scoring all of their points that season he was replaced by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/charles-leclerc/">Charles Leclerc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaguar are the defending teams&#8217; champion in Formula E, having earned 368 points last season through drivers Mitch Evans and Nick Cassidy.</p>



<p>There are several ex-Formula One drivers who have made the move to Formula E over the years, including defending champion Wehrlein.</p>



<p>Others include Nyck de Vries, who competed for Williams and Scuderia AlphaTauri, and Stoffel Vandoorne, who raced for McLaren.</p>

<p>RIHANNA has never been the shy type when it comes to talking about sex and stripping off &#8211; and this week she set pulses racing AGAIN as she showed off her latest Savage X Fenty lingerie range.</p>



<p>The Barbadian beauty, 36 &#8211; who has been in a relationship with the father of her two children, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/18279068/rihanna-asap-rocky-whirlwind-relationship-rumors-cheated/">A$AP Rocky</a> since 2020 &#8211; seductively posed on all fours and gave mega peacocking-vibes <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/video/tvandshowbiz/31735447/rihanna-stuns-as-she-flashes-her-bum-in-stockings-and-suspenders-for-sizzling-new-underwear-shoot/">in nothing but stocking, knickers and a bra</a>.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32125057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32125057" style="width: 753px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rihanna-stuns-latest-savage-x-954488226_55c444.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=753" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32125057" width="753" height="753" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32125057" class="wp-caption-text">Rihanna set pulses racing her in her latest Savage x Fenty campaign</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32125094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32125094" style="width: 756px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rihanna-stuns-latest-savage-x-954488229_94dc88.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=756" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32125094" width="756" height="756" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32125094" class="wp-caption-text">The Barbadian singer stunned as she gave the camera a sultry stare</figcaption></figure>



<p>The saucy campaign celebrates the brand&#8217;s new holiday collection Starlet Nights, which features inclusive and daring underwear from lacy bras to thigh high stockings. </p>



<p>Rihanna launched Savage X Fenty in 2018 &#8211; just one of the arms to her Fenty Corps business. As well as her undie collections, the beauty and skincare brands alone she&#8217;s set up are now valued at an estimated £2.2billion, to which&nbsp;Ri owns a 50 per cent stake.</p>



<p>This latest Savage X Fenty collection comes ahead of the Umbrella singer&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/29837021/rihannas-new-r9-album-new-tour-plans/">hotly anticipated ninth album in 2025</a>, after her a nine-year hiatus and having two baby boys.</p>



<p>But motherhood certainly isn&#8217;t stopping her. She&#8217;s admitted it&#8217;s &#8220;really cool to be a boy mum&#8221; and although she&#8217;s the only female in her household, it&#8217;s inspiring her to be even more of a kick-ass woman than ever before.</p>



<p>“I get to be as casual and busted as I want to, but it also forces me to embrace the epic things about being a woman, and a female and all my femininity,” she said. “I embrace it so much more now, like I wear pink.”</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s clear to see a break from the music to master the art of motherhood hasn&#8217;t dampened the singer&#8217;s sexual prowess &#8211; something she&#8217;s never been afraid to discuss. Over the years the mum-of-two has made some very raunchy confessions.</p>



<p>From a love of spanking to being submissive in the bedroom, she&#8217;s held nothing back&#8230; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">S&amp;M</h2>



<p>In her 2010 pop hit S&amp;M, RiRi famously sang the line &#8220;chains and whips excite me,&#8221; and it seems that these lyrics translate to her personal life.</p>



<p>The star previously told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/excerpts-from-rihannas-rolling-stone-cover-story-10381/beauty-secret-102071/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> that she loves being dominated in the bedroom but admitted that she prefers it when people use their hands.</p>



<p>She said: &#8220;I think I&#8217;m a bit masochistic. I love feeling like I&#8217;m somebody&#8217;s girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love to be tied up and spanked. I like to be whipped. </p>



<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s funny that I care. But I prefer to be spontaneous.</p>



<p>&#8220;Using whips and chains is too planned. You have to stop and look for the whip. </p>



<p>&#8220;I prefer them to use their hands.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nude Pictures</h2>



<p>The busy star has toured the world during her decades-long career, meaning she is often apart from lovers for long <span id="7caf7bce-46c4-430a-bd0d-deea0300af30" class="suggested-link">periods</span> of time.</p>



<p>However, the Fenty Beauty owner revealed that she likes to keep things fun whilst she&#8217;s away by sending saucy snaps. </p>



<p>Rihanna said: &#8220;When you&#8217;re not with the person you want to be intimate with, a picture is the <span id="88e382a7-29e0-4c72-abe9-cf6da61c064b" class="suggested-link">next</span> best thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Skype is safer. But a picture lasts a long time.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p><strong>Chris Brown</strong><br />Rihanna&#8217;s relationship with Chris Brown was one of her most publicised and controversial. The pair began dating in 2007, but their relationship ended in 2009 after Brown physically assaulted Rihanna, leading to a highly publicised court case. Despite the incident, there were rumours of reconciliation over the years, but their relationship ultimately remained strained.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Kemp</strong><br />After her split with Chris Brown, Rihanna dated professional baseball player Matt Kemp in 2010. Their relationship was relatively short-lived, lasting less than a year. Despite the brief romance, Kemp was a significant figure in Rihanna&#8217;s dating history as she moved on from a tumultuous past relationship.</p>
<p>Drake<br />Rihanna and Canadian rapper Drake had an on-again, off-again romance that spanned several years. Their relationship was marked by numerous collaborations and public appearances, showcasing their undeniable chemistry. However, despite their close connection, they never managed to establish a long-term relationship.</p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio<br />Rihanna was also linked to Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio in early 2015. Though their relationship was never officially confirmed, they were spotted together at several events and parties. The rumours of their romance generated significant media buzz, given their high profiles in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Travis Scott<br />Around 2015, Rihanna was romantically linked with American rapper Travis Scott. Their relationship was relatively low-key compared to her other high-profile romances, but still attracted considerable media attention. </p>
<p>Hassan Jameel<br />Rihanna&#8217;s relationship with Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel was one of her longest, lasting from 2017 to early 2020. The couple kept their relationship largely out of the public eye, maintaining a level of privacy that was unusual for Rihanna&#8217;s usual high-profile romances. Despite their efforts, they eventually parted ways after nearly three years together.</p>
<p>A$AP Rocky<br />Rihanna has been in a relationship with A$AP Rocky since 2020. The pair share two children, RZA Athelaston Mayers, 2 and Riot Rose Mayers, 1.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re alone, and those horny moments come up, pictures can be very handy. I haven&#8217;t gotten a d*ck picture in a long time. </p>



<p>&#8220;I think people are a little afraid. It can turn out bad.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_32128030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32128030" style="width: 782px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pregnant-rihanna-shows-off-growing-831066774.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=782" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32128030" width="782" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32128030" class="wp-caption-text">RiRI said she likes to send saucy snaps when she&#8217;s away from her beau</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Submission</h2>



<p>As a busy mum and career-focused woman, Rihanna often has to make a lot of executive decisions.</p>



<p>So when it comes to the bedroom, RiRi enjoys it when somebody else takes control.</p>



<p>She revealed: &#8220;I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive.</p>



<p>&#8220;Being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. </p>



<p>&#8220;You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge of your sh*t.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sexy to me. I work a lot, and I have to make a lot of executive decisions, so when it comes to being intimate, I like to feel like I&#8217;m somebody&#8217;s girl.&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_32128108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32128108" style="width: 781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rihanna-savage-x-fenty-valentine-630438951.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=781" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32128108" width="781" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32128108" class="wp-caption-text">The singer enjoys being submissive in the bedroom</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No One Night Stands</h2>



<p>Rihanna has been in a committed relationship with ASAP Rocky since 2020, but back in her single days, she revealed that she wouldn&#8217;t go for one night stands when she was in the mood.</p>



<p>She previously told Variety: &#8220;If I wanted to, I would completely [have a one-night stand]. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am going to do what makes me feel happy, what I feel like doing. </p>



<p>&#8220;But that would be empty for me; that to me is a hollow move. I would wake up the next day feeling like s**t.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ri reiterated: &#8220;That&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t been having sex or even really seeing anybody.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t want to wake up the next day feeling guilty. I mean, I get horny, I&#8217;m human, I&#8217;m a woman, I want to have sex. </p>



<p>&#8220;But what am I going to do — just find the first random cute dude that I think is going to be a great ride for the night and then tomorrow I wake up feeling empty and hollow? </p>



<p>&#8220;He has a great story and I&#8217;m like… &#8216;What am I doing?&#8217; I can&#8217;t do it to myself. I cannot. It has a little bit to do with fame and a lot to do with the woman that I am. And that saves me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the duo finished their news segment, they transitioned to a sports update with Mike Bushell.</p>



<p>Following his segment, Mike was left hanging after he signed off saying: &#8220;There we are&#8230;&#8221; </p>



<p>Yet the camera stayed fixed on him, prompting him to gesture to the team. Charlie quipped: &#8220;Sorry, Mike, I didn&#8217;t realise you&#8217;d finished there. My apologies!&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;There was a moment there I thought you were building up the momentum.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bemused Mike retorted: &#8220;Well I could have done, I&#8217;m looking forward to what is coming <span id="799ed644-3719-427f-ba95-8d20ef12c2d7" class="suggested-link">next</span>!&#8221;</p>



<p>But things still did not move forward, leaving the exasperated cameramen to pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>It was a bit of an embarrassment for the team &#8211; followed by an earlier blunder this week. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/sally-nugent/">Sally Nugent</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jon-kay/">Jon Kay</a> presented, it came time to hand over to the weatherman, Matt Taylor, who would cover for Carol Kirkwood. Things turned frosty. </p>



<p>Matt attempted to display his <span id="4f857576-f703-41cf-944c-6a3ae7f54253" class="suggested-link">weather</span> charts, but a technical mishap struck and they failed to materialised. </p>



<p>He began the weather report with &#8220;We&#8217;re flip-flopping from one extreme to another at the moment but another cold one this morning, a temperature drop through the night&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>But then as he tried to show viewers the graphics, he hit the button in vain.</p>

<p>He continued, &#8220;Some of the coldest spots are indeed in Scotland and Northern Ireland right now, and temperatures are down to minus five degrees.&#8221; </p>



<p>But Matt increasingly became exasperated temporarily let down his guard for a moment and mumbled: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can get these charts to work; it doesn&#8217;t really want to work.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pragmatic Sally commented, &#8220;I think you would have gotten away with that if we hadn&#8217;t just mentioned it.&#8221; </p>



<p>John joked: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s so cold your computer graphics have <span id="ca1e9502-deb9-4ea6-8c5b-792ab2274971" class="suggested-link">frozen</span>. Get the de-icer out!&#8221;</p>



<p>Matt continued, &#8220;Tomorrow morning, it will be a cold start. I&#8217;ll have details on all of that and hopefully get the graphics to work in about half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>BRITS have been warned about &#8216;suitcase and airport malaria&#8217; ahead of Christmas travels  &#8211; after reports of the highest number of cases seen in the UK in over two decades. </p>



<p>The UK <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/health/">Health</a> Security Agency (UKHSA) said dengue and malaria infections had been confirmed in UK <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/travellers/">travellers</a> returning from abroad, amid a surge in travel-related cases of the mosquito borne bugs. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32131039" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32131039" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/travel-plane-woman-passenger-waiting-953335934.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32131039" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32131039" class="wp-caption-text">Brits jetting off for Christmas have been warned about malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32130958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130958" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2019-abdoulilah-ahmed-abdi-health-950283942.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130958" width="960" height="557" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130958" class="wp-caption-text">Malaria, dengue and Zika are transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes</figcaption></figure>



<p>The health watchdog urged holidaymakers to protect themselves from getting bitten when heading abroad. </p>



<p>Malaria is a serious infection spread by mozzie bites. </p>



<p>Though it isn&#8217;t found in the UK, Brits are at risk of getting it when jetting off to tropical spots it&#8217;s commonly found in &#8211; such as Central and South America and parts of Asia and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/africa/">Africa</a>. </p>



<p>The potentially fatal disease can be almost completely avoided by taking malaria prevention tablets when appropriate. </p>



<p>Dengue is another illness spread by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/mosquitoes/">mosquitoes</a>, which has also been found in European holiday hotspots during warmer months &#8211; such as <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196714/croatia/">Croatia</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/france/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/italy/">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/spain/">Spain</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/portugal/">Portugal</a>. </p>



<p>Though it&#8217;s not usually serious, some people can develop severe dengue that can be dangerous if not treated promptly in hospital. </p>



<p>UKHSA&#8217;s annual malaria report shows there were 2,106 cases of imported malaria reported in the UK in 2023 &#8211; marking a 26 per cent rise on the 1,555 cases reported in 2022. </p>



<p>This is the highest total number of cases seen in the UK since 2001, the health watchdog said. </p>



<p>Six malaria-related deaths were also reported in the UK in 2023 &#8211; in line with the annual average of six deaths recorded between 2014 and 2023.</p>



<p>Provisional figures for this year indicate there were 753 travel-acquired malaria reported in the UK between January and June 2024.</p>

<p>The rise in cases is linked to the resurgence of malaria in many countries and increased overseas travel following the removal of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/pandemic/">pandemic</a> restrictions.</p>



<p>Aside from imported malaria infections, health experts have also shared warnings about rising rates of<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31081981/suitcase-airport-malaria-spread-europe/"> Odyssean malaria</a> &#8211; cases resulting from the bite of an infected mosquito transported by aircraft, luggage, or parcel from an endemic area.</p>



<p>Of 6,131 cases of malaria reported in the EU/EEA in 2022, 99 per cent were travel-related, a recent study found. </p>



<p>A separate report into other mosquito-borne infections between January and June 2024, found there were 473 dengue cases reported in travellers returning to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/england/">England</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/wales/">Wales</a>, and Northern <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ireland/">Ireland</a>. </p>



<p>This is a significant increase from the 157 cases reported during the same period in 2023 and the highest number of cases reported in the first six months of any year since dengue surveillance began in 2009. </p>



<p>According to UKHSA, the surge reflects the substantial rise in dengue cases reported globally in 2024, which prompted the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to recently recommended a dengue vaccine for some travellers.</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					Malaria is a serious infection spread by mosquitoes. 				</p>

			<div>
<p>If it&#8217;s not diagnosed and treated quickly, you can die from it.</p>
<p>Malaria is caused by being bitten by an infected mosquito and it can take just one bite to get it. </p>
<p>It can be hard to spot, but symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high temperature, sweats and chills</li>
<li>Headaches and feeling confused</li>
<li>Feeling very tired and sleepy (especially in children)</li>
<li>Feeling and being sick, tummy pain and diarrhoea</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Muscle pains</li>
<li>Yellow skin or whites of the eyes</li>
<li>A sore throat, cough and difficulty breathing</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms usually appear between seven and 18 days after you&#8217;ve been bitten by an infected mosquito.</p>
<p>But sometimes you may not have symptoms for months after travel, and rarely years.</p>
<p>Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if you have travelled to a country where malaria is found and have malaria symptoms. </p>
<p>The infection is very common in certain parts of the world, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large areas of Africa and Asia</li>
<li>Central and South America</li>
<li>Dominican Republic and Haiti</li>
<li>parts of the Middle East</li>
<li>Some Pacific islands</li>
</ul>
<p>Malaria is not found in the UK and you can&#8217;t catch it from another person.</p>
<p>Source: <em><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/malaria/" rel="nofollow">NHS</a> </em></p>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>The report also examined the number of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/zika-virus/">Zika virus</a> cases brought to the UK. </p>



<p>Between January and June 2024, eight Zika cases were reported in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/england/">England</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/wales/">Wales</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/northern-ireland/">Northern Ireland</a> &#8211; only one more than the amount recorded last year. </p>



<p>Most cases were linked to travel in South-East Asia, UKHSA said. </p>



<p>Although Zika virus cases are rare, infection can be particularly risky to pregnant women as they can pass the illness onto their unborn baby. </p>



<p>There is no drug or vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection, so the only way of dodging it is to avoid getting bitten by mozzies or not travelling to regions where mozzies carrying the virus thrive. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to protect yourself when travelling </h2>



<p>Dr Philip Veal, consultant in public health at UKHSA, said: “As many people prepare to travel over the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/">winter</a> period, it is important to take precautions against serious mosquito-borne infections.</p>



<p>&#8220;Simple <span id="cb719d8a-f00d-4045-a0fd-6c048a2019bf" class="suggested-link">steps</span>, such as using insect repellent, covering exposed skin, and sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, can help reduce the risk of malaria, dengue, and Zika virus infection.</p>



<p>&#8220;Taking malaria prevention tablets appropriately is highly effective in avoiding the disease.&#8221;</p>



<p>He recommended checking the TravelHealthPro website before embarking on any trips for the latest health advice on your destination.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you’ve been to a country before, remember that you don’t have the same level of protection against infections as permanent residents and are still at risk,&#8221; Dr Veal noted. </p>



<p>Dr Dipti Patel, director of the National Travel Health Network and Centre, recommended checking in with your <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/gp/">GP</a>, pharmacy, or travel health clinic at least four to six weeks before the trip to ensure your vaccinations are up to date and for health advice.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ll be able to supply you with malaria prevention tablets if you need them. </p>



<p>You may also be eligible for dengue vaccine, so it&#8217;s important you speak to a health professional three to four months before travel.</p>



<p>The vaccine is only recommended for some travellers that have been infected with dengue in the past. </p>



<p>In countries with insects that spread diseases like dengue, malaria or Zika virus infection and Oropouche virus disease, protect yourself by using insect repellent, covering exposed skin, and sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net. </p>



<p>Dr Patel noted: &#8220;Upon returning to the UK, if feeling unwell, individuals should seek medical attention and inform their healthcare provider about their recent travel.”</p>

			<h3 class="article-boxout__headline">Essential travel tips </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p>Before travelling this Christmas, check: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your childhood vaccinations are up to date </li>
<li>You&#8217;ve had recommended travel-related jabs </li>
<li>You&#8217;re stocked up on necessary medications </li>
<li>You&#8217;ve got valid travel insurance to cover your whole trip and planned activities </li>
</ul>
</div>
		</div>
	</div>




<p>UKHSA also flagged a recent global rise in Oropouche infections, although there have been no confirmed cases  in the UK this year. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/30970240/sloth-fever-sex-europe-oropouche/">Oropouche virus</a> tends to circulate between primates like sloths &#8211; hence its nickname &#8216;sloth fever&#8217;. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s mostly spread by midge bites rather than mosquito bites.</p>



<p>&#8220;Due to the increase in cases, and some recent concerns regarding OROV infection during <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/pregnancy/">pregnancy</a>, pregnant travellers should take particular care,&#8221; UKHSA noted. </p>



<p>&#8220;A recent study found Oropouche virus in the semen of an infected individual, suggesting sexual transmission may be possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Travellers concerned about spreading OROV through sex should consider using condoms or avoiding sex during travel and for six weeks after returning.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also been suggested that the virus can be <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31805444/baby-stillborn-mum-sloth-fever-oropouche-virus-passed-womb">passed on through the womb</a>, after a mum tragically lost her baby before it was born following infection with the virus.</p>

<p>RUBEN AMORIM has revealed four Manchester United players have a &#8220;time limit&#8221; on the pitch at the moment due to their fitness levels.</p>



<p>The Portuguese coach, 39, suffered his first defeat as Red Devils boss on Wednesday night in a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32118754/arsenal-man-utd-result-ruben-amorim-arteta-liverpool/" rel="">2-0 loss to Arsenal</a> at the Emirates.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32127882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32127882" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/r-ben-amorim-954740055.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32127882" width="960" height="499" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32127882" class="wp-caption-text">Rúben Amorim admitted some of his players have a &#8216;time limit&#8217; on the pitch</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ruben-amorim/" rel="">Amorim</a> made six changes to his starting line-up from the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/32045947/man-utd-everton-amorim-rashford-zirkzee/" rel="">4-0 win over Everton</a>.</p>



<p>He brought the likes of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harry-maguire/" rel="">Harry Maguire</a>, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount in from the cold after little game time over the last 12 months.</p>



<p>But before the hour mark he took Maguire and Mount off for Leny Yoro and Marcus Rashford.</p>



<p>Alejandro Garnacho was also replaced by Joshua Zirkzee, while Antony came on in the 79th minute for Rasmus Hojlund.</p>



<p>It has been a mark of Amorim&#8217;s first four games in charge that he has not been afraid to change up his team &#8211; far more than his predecessor <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/erik-ten-hag/" rel="">Erik ten Hag</a>.</p>



<p>But he has admitted part of the reason is because he is having to manage the minutes of Maguire, Malacia, Mount and Yoro.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;It&#8217;s not because I like to change all the time but we have to have all the squad fit.</p>



<p>&#8220;For example, Harry Maguire has a time limit, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount have time limits. Leny Yoro really has a time limit.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to manage winning games in a different methodology, different way of playing, more metres to press.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow we have to assess and the guys who have a little bit of a risk to some injury will not play.</p>

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					RUBEN AMORIM lost his first game since taking charge of Man Utd after a 2-0 loss to Arsenal at the Emirates.				</p>

			<div>
<p>See how the players rated…</p>
<p><strong>ANDRE ONANA – 5<br /></strong>He was let off early in the game after a stray pass saw Gabriel Martinelli put the ball in the net before the linesman raised his flag.</p>
<p>Failed to command his area as 5&#8243;10 Jurrien Timber leapt highest to rattle the back of his net, before the ball floated to the back post for Arsenal to score their second set piece.</p>
<p><strong>DIOGO DALOT – 6<br /></strong>Flashed a shot just wide at the end of the first half when he did eventually get forward.</p>
<p>Not bad defensively but more dangerous going forwards.</p>
<p><strong>MATTHIJS DE LIGT – 6<br /></strong>Formed a good partnership with Maguire in the first half, and fans will be hoping he is okay after suffering a slight knock.</p>
<p>Needed to be a more commanding figure in the box to stop being dominated by The Gunners at set pieces.</p>
<p><strong>HARRY MAGUIRE – 7<br /></strong>Was actually very impressive in the first half, with a solid showing.</p>
<p>Not at fault for Timber&#8217;s header hitting the back of the net, before he was replaced by Leny Yoro.</p>
<p><strong>NOUSSAIR MAZRAOUI – 6<br /></strong>Playing as a left-sided centre-back he looked fairly comfortable, which is a credit to the Moroccan&#8217;s versatility.</p>
<p>That said, he still looked better off in the role that Malacia, then Dalot occupied tonight as a left-wingback.</p>
<p><strong>TYRELL MALACIA – 3<br /></strong>Noticeably looked extremely physically weak up against Bukayo Saka on the left-hand side, before being booked for a kick out at Kai Havertz.</p>
<p>Offered nothing going forward and his link-up with Garnacho was practically non-existent. Hooked at half-time for the far more threatening Amad.</p>
<p><strong>MANUEL UGARTE – 5<br /></strong>Another one who was booked in the first half, he failed to establish any kind of presence in the game and on the ball, looked pretty woeful.</p>
<p>Cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off of his own line to stop Arsenal from doubling their lead early in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>BRUNO FERNANDES – 4<br /></strong>This game was crying out for Bruno Fernandes to stamp his authority on it, and it seemed he just couldn&#8217;t quite get his foot on the ball to do so.</p>
<p>Played a deeper role today, next to Ugarte, which meant we didn&#8217;t see any of his attacking spark.</p>
<p><strong>MASON MOUNT – 3<br /></strong>Mason Mount at right wing was an experiment tried and failed at Chelsea, which Amorim tried again tonight.</p>
<p>He was often lost in the half-space, meaning he was essentially useless going forwards. Hooked in the second half after a fairly abysmal showing.</p>
<p><strong>ALEJANDRO GARNACHO – 5<br /></strong>A very quiet first half, only brightened by one half-decent cross, was met by a second half where he was quickly subbed for Marcus Rashford.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>RASMUS HOJLUND – 6<br /></strong>Battled well with the physical presence of William Saliba early on, but his side failed to create him any kind of chances.</p>
<p>Cut a frustrated figure for most of the match, and rightly so. There will be no point signing Gyokeres if they can&#8217;t create anything for him to score.</p>
<p><strong>SUBS<br />AMAD (TYRELL MALACIA, HT) – 5</strong></p>
<p>Was more direct and definitely an improvement on Malacia, albeit on the opposite flank.</p>
<p>However, still wasn&#8217;t able to be the difference which Ruben Amorim would&#8217;ve been looking for in this one.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS RASHFORD (MASON MOUNT, 72) – 5</strong></p>
<p>Having been electric on the whole under Amorim, he wasn&#8217;t able to provide any kind of spark against an opponent which has been one of his favourites in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>JOSHUA ZIRKZEE (ALEJANDRO GARNACHO, 72) – 4</strong></p>
<p>After an impressive display last time out, he failed to offer anything to his side going forward today.</p>
<p>The closest he came to scoring was a dangerous header which almost saw him get an own goal on the scoresheet.</p>
<p><strong>LENY YORO (HARRY MAGUIRE, 72) – 6</strong></p>
<p>Looks like a pretty good defender on the whole, a tough game for a young centre-back, but he didn&#8217;t look out of place whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>ANTONY (RASMUS HOJLUND, 79) – 5</strong></p>
<p>Played his part in a clever free-kick routine at the end of the game, before fluffing his lines and finding the gloves of David Raya.</p>

<p>SEVERAL areas in Canterbury will benefit from a huge multi-million revamp &#8211; and it&#8217;s great news for visitors.  </p>



<p>The £22million project will see <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/canterbury/" rel="">Canterbury</a> Castle and public squares near Westgate Towers and St George’s Clocktower revamped. </p>



<figure id="attachment_32130700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130700" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/finish-date-canterbury-city-centre-954743137.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=750" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130700" width="750" height="511" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130700" class="wp-caption-text">Part of the Government&#8217;s Levelling Up Fund, work is already underway on some of the projects</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32130698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130698" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/finish-date-canterbury-city-centre-954743140.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=750" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130698" width="750" height="430" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130698" class="wp-caption-text">Several parks in the city will be developed, with exhibitions opening about the history of the city</figcaption></figure>



<p>Part of the Government&#8217;s Levelling Up Fund, work is already underway to reopen Canterbury Castle. </p>



<p>The square in front of the Westgate Towers in Canterbury will also be reimagined as part of a wider regeneration project. </p>



<p>The area in front of the landmark will get new paving, creating a more pedestrianized square with less traffic &#8211; although vehicle access will remain in place. </p>



<p>While it won&#8217;t be a shared space, according to Canterbury City Council, the new layout will make the area better for events like the Medieval Pageant and the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/christmas-2/">Christmas</a> lights parade. </p>



<p>A new coffee house and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/wine/">wine</a> bar overlooking the square will also be built in the former Barretts <span id="a5a88c17-dded-44ee-8f90-78efc78e1c3a" class="suggested-link">Jaguar</span> showroom.</p>



<p>The new restaurant will be called Fellons and will be the latest <span id="7dcd9cad-38e8-4829-9dba-f419096a6ba9" class="suggested-link">business</span> venture of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/business/">business</a> partners Steve Allen and James Caldon. </p>



<p>Allen and Caldon already run a restaurant and an escape room in Canterbury. </p>



<p>Mr Allen told <a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/thanet/news/new-era-for-historic-kent-location-as-work-to-start-on-mul-316860/" target="_blank" aria-label="Kent Online (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span id="11862f11-248f-4a9c-b85a-36ef98cef835" class="suggested-link">Kent</span> Online</a>: &#8220;There is a big year ahead and exciting times for the Westgate, which is on the brink of a new era as a gateway to the city. </p>



<p>&#8220;The iconic medieval towers always deserved to be better showcased and we were privileged to become the custodians of the building.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, the new square and Westgate One student redevelopment, together with our new cafe/wine bar and the new experiences we are planning for the Westgate Towers, will transform the area.&#8221;</p>

<p>Construction work will start on the new square <span id="80f89c8b-7f24-4f9d-be26-ae4292f67756" class="suggested-link">next</span> year. </p>



<p>Dane John Gardens will also be renovated as part of the project, while parks like St Mary Magdalene Gardens and St Mary de Castro Gardens will be transformed into &#8220;story gardens&#8221; featuring exhibits about Canterbury&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/history/">history</a>. </p>



<p>And Canterbury isn&#8217;t the only city in the UK set to benefit from a huge multi-million-pound renovation project. </p>



<p>A former industrial site in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/32081268/uk-city-new-urban-area-canalside-restaurant-hotel-gardens/" rel="">Stoke-on-Trent is set to get a £60million revamp</a>. </p>



<p>Located between Stoke-on-Trent Train Station and the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal, the Goods Yard is a new urban neighbourhood in the city.</p>



<p>The first phase of the £60million development will be completed&nbsp;next&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/spring/">spring</a>, with work already underway on a hotly-anticipated public square.</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stoke.gov.uk/news/article/1666/construction_work_starts_on_new_public_square_at_goods_yard_neighbourhood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">site&#8217;s developers</a>, Capital&amp;Centric, the new square will feature a lawn area that&#8217;s the same size as a&nbsp;tennis&nbsp;court, a walkway, hangout spaces, seating areas and over 70 trees and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/plants/">plants</a>.</p>



<p>There will also be a space for pop-up <span id="834ea4d0-5867-4bd9-a97c-3a44dcdb4c23" class="suggested-link">markets</span> and live music events, which both locals and holidaymakers will be able to visit.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more than enough history in Chaucer’s home city to keep you busy for an entire week.</p>
<p>There is a warren of medieval Tudor buildings, a Norman castle, Roman ruins and, of course, its immense cathedral.</p>
<p>Look out for ancient treasures from further afield too. The Beaney House of Art And Knowledge (<a href="https://canterburymuseums.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canterburymuseums.co.uk</a>) is home to oddities ranging from an Egyptian mummified cat to African daggers taken from captured slave-trading ships.</p>
<p>The King’s Mile is a great strolling route that takes you past boutiques and curio shops galore. Try the deliciously carnivorous Pork And Co (<a href="https://porkandco.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">porkandco.co.uk</a>) for a bite.</p>
<p>The delights on offer here include slow-cooked, free-range smoked pork rolls with plenty of sauce and slaw.</p>
<p>The Canterbury Cathedral Lodge is in the grounds of the cathedral and has rooms from £107 B&amp;B. For more information see <a href="https://www.canterburycathedrallodge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canterburycathedrallodge.org</a>.</p>

<p>GREGG Wallace&#8217;s top telly rival is &#8220;pulling ahead&#8221; in the race to replace him on MasterChef.</p>



<p>The former greengrocer has quit as co-host of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/bbc/">BBC</a> show as he is investigated for a barrage of <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31988939/gregg-wallace-steps-down-masterchef-probe/">off-screen misconduct</a> complaints.</p>

<p>Yet the 60-year-old has now stepped away from the long-running show while historical misconduct allegations against him are investigated.</p>



<p>And with him taking the leave, fellow TV chef <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/james-martin/">James Martin</a>, 52, is a shoo-in to replace him in the role, according to bookies.</p>



<p>The fan favourite Yorkshireman is a staple on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a> series James Martin&#8217;s Saturday Morning after previously fronting Saturday Kitchen on the BBC.</p>



<p>Now it&#8217;s claimed his &#8220;impressive&#8221; career could see him replace Gregg, and front <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/masterchef/">MasterChef</a> alongside <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/john-torode/">John Torode</a>, 59.</p>



<p>Bookies <a href="https://www.betfred.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">BetFred</a> have priced him as favourite, with odds of 5/2 to replace Gregg.</p>



<p>Yet John&#8217;s wife Lisa Faulkner is in the frame with odds of 3/1, Nigella Lawson at 4/1 and Gino D&#8217;Acampo at 5/1.</p>



<p>Betfred spokesperson Kayley Cornelius said: “With Gregg Wallace unlikely to return to MasterChef, the big question is who might step into his shoes. </p>



<p>&#8220;At the moment, TV chef James Martin is the bookies’ favourite to take over as the new face of the iconic series, with odds of 5/2. </p>



<p>&#8220;With experience hosting Saturday Kitchen and regularly appearing on This Morning, a prime-time show could be the perfect next step in James&#8217;s already impressive career.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">STATE OF PLAY</h2>



<p>MasterChef&#8217;s production company, Banijay UK, has said law firm Lewis Silkin would <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32034502/masterchef-bosses-give-major-update-gregg-wallace/">lead the investigation</a> into Wallace’s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32032217/gregg-wallace-yelled-stupid-cow-groping-masterchef/">alleged misconduct</a>.</p>



<p>They also confirmed Gregg will be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32000516/gregg-wallace-blindsided-bbc-announcement-probe/">“stepping away” from MasterChef.</a></p>



<p>It said: “This week the BBC received complaints from individuals in relation to historical allegations of misconduct while working with presenter Gregg Wallace on one of our shows.</p>



<p>“While this review is under way, Gregg Wallace will be stepping away from his role on MasterChef and is committed to fully co-operating throughout the process.</p>



<p>“Banijay UK’s duty of care to staff is always a priority and our expectations regarding behaviour are made clear to both cast and crew on all productions.”</p>



<p>Gregg &#8211; married to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3268459/gregg-wallace-wife-anne-marie-sterpini/">Anne-Marie Sterpini</a> — hit back, claiming: “The allegations were investigated six years ago and my comments were found to be not sexual. I repeat, not sexual. Thank you everybody for your time.”</p>



<p>Last year, he stepped down from another BBC show, Inside The Factory, amid allegations he was “rude to staff and continued to talk in a derogatory manner, especially to women.”</p>

<p>THE festive season is the best time to go all out with your dressy outfits &#8211; but can also be a minefield for fashion mistakes.</p>



<p>Fashion expert Giorgio Ammirabile, from <a aria-label="CSD (opens in a new tab)" href="https://csd.shop/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CSD</a>, has revealed that there are four common faux pas&#8217; that fashionistas make with their Christmas party looks.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32130947" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130947" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/without-looking-tacky-see-pa-950908979.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=620" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130947" width="620" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130947" class="wp-caption-text">A fashion expert has warned against sequins for Christmas outfits</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if you&#8217;ve still got your office night out to go, or dinner and drinks with pals, then you might want to take notes.</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s still time to hit the high street or supermarket for a new outfit.</p>



<p>Here, Giorgio reveals what to avoid&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Christmas tree look</h2>



<p>Giorgio says: &#8220;It might seem obvious, but wearing red and green together is a no-go &#8211; especially at Christmas. You’ll end up looking like a festive decoration or elf rather than a party guest.&#8221; </p>



<p>Instead. he advises fashion fans to &#8220;leave their novelty sweaters at home&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Opt for more refined colours like deep metallics or jewel tones&#8221; he added. </p>



<p>&#8220;If you’re set on wearing either red or green, then choose one. An emerald dress or deep red blouse paired with neutral accessories will provide a balanced look.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ditch the sequins</h2>



<p>This one might cause some upset, but Giorgio has argued that the popular sequins dresses and outfits can look cheap.</p>



<p>He said: &#8220;Sparkle might be synonymous with this time of year, but too much can be tacky. </p>



<p>&#8220;If you do want a dazzling look, then try metallic fabrics like silk or lurex blends. They give you the same shine but with more sophistication, and you won’t look like Christmas lights. </p>

<p>&#8220;For a show-stopping outfit, consider a dress or jumpsuit in gold, silver or bronze. It’s festive and very elegant.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to accessories.</h2>



<p>Next up, Giorgio has insisted that accessories can &#8220;make or break an outfit&#8221;. </p>



<p>He told Fabulous: &#8220;My best advice is to start with a chic black clutch. It’s versatile and always in style. </p>



<p>&#8220;Then, consider shoes. Heels are always a good option, but choose wisely. If you’re going to be dancing all night, opt for a manageable heel height that means you’re comfortable and confident. </p>



<p>&#8220;When it comes to jewellery, gold and silver are timeless choices. Dark outfits look great with contrasting statement earrings or a sparkling necklace. </p>



<p>&#8220;And equally, these can be paired with a light-coloured look for subtle glamour. Less is always more, so don’t pile everything on!&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_32130949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130949" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/i-m-excited-launch-new-948909181.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130949" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130949" class="wp-caption-text">Rita Ora&#8217;s LBD for Primark went viral &#8211; but Giorgio urges people to &#8216;branch out&#8217; for Christmas</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Think beyond the LBD</h2>



<p>Finally, a little black dress is an essential in every woman&#8217;s wardrobe.</p>



<p>But Giorgio has urged Christmas fanatics to &#8220;branch out&#8221; when it comes to a special festive bash.</p>



<p>He saud: &#8220;They [LBDs] might be a festive staple, but relying on them too much can mean your style is predictable. </p>



<script type="application/javascript" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/pollingwidgets/v3/widget.js?question_id=99046&#038;game=polling"></script>



<p>&#8220;Instead, branch out and opt for vibrant options in bold colours and rich textures like satin and velvet.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;Finally, remember that fashion should be fun &#8211; especially at this time of year. </p>



<p>&#8220;Just remember to skip the Christmas cliches, embrace elegance and by following these tips you can make this festive season your most stylish yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>After grooming the girl, Awan began to sexually abuse her while they were on a trip in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/france/">France</a> to watch a cheerleading event.</p>



<p>Once they returned to the UK, the pair would often meet at Awan&#8217;s home or her houses belonging to her relatives.</p>



<p>The paedo coach has now been jailed for ten years after being convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child.</p>



<p>She was also found guilty of one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/leicester/">Leicester</a> Crown <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/courts">Court</a>.</p>



<p>As well as a jail sentence, Awan was made subject to a ten-year restraining order banning contact with the victim.</p>



<p>She will also have to sign the sex offenders register for life and was handed a ten-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.</p>



<p>Following the case, the victim &#8211; now aged 27 &#8211; thanked the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/">police</a> officers who helped her, saying: &#8220;I couldn’t have done it without you both.&#8221;</p>



<p>DC Catherine Anderson, said: “This case involved a person in a position of trust taking advantage of a person in their care, and Awan’s behaviour towards her young victim was predatory.</p>



<p>“I’m so pleased the victim came forward to report her behaviour, recognising it for what it was many years later.</p>



<p>“I’d urge anyone in the same position to come forward. We will take your reports seriously and investigate thoroughly.”</p>

<p>PEOPLE are only just releasing they are using their hot water bottle wrong. </p>



<p>The cheap and easy-to-use heating device is a staple in many <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/homes/">homes</a> over the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/winter/">winter</a> months. </p>



<figure id="attachment_20532055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20532055" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14807060-a15b-404e-a8d2-55abacc1f98a.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=576" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-20532055" width="576" height="770" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20532055" class="wp-caption-text">People are only just realising what the symbols on hot water bottles mean – and it’s blowing their minds</figcaption></figure>



<p>But <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/lancashire/">Lancashire</a> Fire and Rescue Safety Service is now warning households to be aware of the unusual code at the neck of their hot water bottle. </p>



<p>The community group explained the symbol &#8211; which looks like a flower &#8211; is actually a tool to help you figure out the expiry date of the product. </p>



<p>A post read: &#8220;If your hot water bottle is more than two years old from the manufacturing date, it is at risk of leaking or bursting. </p>



<p>&#8220;Look for the &#8216;Flower Wheel&#8217; or &#8216;Daisy Wheel&#8217; on the funnel or neck of your hot water bottle. </p>



<p>&#8220;This will show you the manufacturing date.&#8221;</p>



<p>The news shocked many people with some completely unaware you had to replace a hot water bottle. </p>



<p>&#8220;I’m still using the one I had as a kid in 1984,&#8221; said one user. </p>



<p>While another said their hot water bottle was made in 2003. </p>



<p>Others chimed in with cautionary tales, with one woman sharing how she<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/31651976/out-of-date-hot-water-bottle-burst/"> ended up in hospital </a>from using an out-of-date water bottle. </p>



<p>She said:  &#8220;Please anyone who has a bottle over 2 years old please please bin it. </p>

<p>&#8220;I was scalded by a hot water bottle only 4 weeks ago as I didn’t know they had a 2-year shelf life. &#8220;</p>



<p>She added:&#8221; &#8220;I am still going to the hospital twice a week for dressing changes which bloody hurt. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another woman thanked the service for sharing the warning and said she would throw her &#8220;current ones out and buy new ones&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO CHECK YOUR HOT WATER BOTTLE</h2>



<p>For starters, look for the number in the centre of the wheel that shows the year it was made &#8211; so if it says 20 it was made in 2020. </p>



<p>As for the 12 petals around the wheel, these represent the months of the year. </p>



<p>You might have also noticed the dots inside some of the petals, this is  to indicate the weeks of that month. </p>



<p>For example, three dots in five petals mean the product was made in the third month of May. </p>



<p>If you find your hot water bottle is out of date you may want to consider replacing it for safety reasons. </p>



<p>A spokesperson from The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, previously told The Sun:: “Hot water bottles that are past their expiration dates should not be supplied. </p>



<p>“Their expiration date is generally around two years from the date of manufacture. “While there are no specific regulations for hot water bottles, general product safety legislation says that only safe goods should be placed on the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They added: Therefore, it is recommended that hot water bottles older than two years are not supplied to ensure consumer safety.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE?</h2>



<p>If you are not keen on using a hot water bottle then you may want to consider these alternatives.</p>



<p>For example, an electric blanket can help you stay warm and is cheaper than turning on the central heating. </p>



<p>Tesco is currently selling one by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/32120187/supermarket-electric-blanket-five-star-half-price-tesco/">Slumberdown </a>and it comes with three heat settings and is reduced from £24 to £17.</p>



<p> You could also stay warm by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/31856165/seven-winter-gadgets-to-avoid-a-big-energy-bill/">buying other warming gadgets</a>, such as an electric heating pad.</p>



<p>Costing £34.99 on Amazon, the product keeps you warm but uses less than a tenth of the power of an electric heater.</p>



<p>The Sun&#8217;s Rosie Taylor recently reviewed the top heating gadgets on this market this winter, which you can check out <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/31856165/seven-winter-gadgets-to-avoid-a-big-energy-bill/">here.</a></p>

			<h3 class="article-boxout__headline">5 ways to keep your house warm in winter </h3>
		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">

							<p class="article__content--intro">
					Property expert Joshua Houston shared his tips. 				</p>

			<div>
<p><strong>1. Curtains </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Windows are a common place for the outside cold to get into your home, this is because of small gaps that can let in air so always close your curtains as soon as it gets dark,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>This simple method gives you an extra layer of warmth as it can provide a kind of &#8220;insulation&#8221; between your window and curtain.</p>
<p><strong>2. Rugs </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Your floor is another area of your home where heat can be lost and can make your home feel chilly,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;You might notice on cold days, that your floor is not nice to walk on due to it freezing your feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Add rugs to areas that don’t already have a carpet, this provides a layer of insulation between your bare floor and the room above.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Check your insulation </strong></p>
<p>Check your pipes, loft space, crawlspaces and underneath floorboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loose-fill insulation is very good for this, and is a more affordable type of insulation, with a big bag being able to be picked up for around £30,&#8221; Joshua explained.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep your internal doors closed </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Household members often gather in one room in the evening, and this is usually either the kitchen or living room,&#8221; Joshua said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This means you only have to heat a small area of your home, and closing the doors keeps the heat in and the cold out.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Block drafts </strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check cat flaps, chimneys and letterboxes, as they can let in cold air if they aren&#8217;t secure.</p>

<p>DAVID Blakely was a racecar driver who was murdered by his girlfriend Ruth Ellis, after he subjected her to abuse throughout their relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The days leading up to his <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/31944531/ruth-ellis-nightclub-manageress-murderer-woman-hanged/">death at Ruth’s hands</a> will be dramatised in the upcoming ITV series A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Born racer</strong></h2>



<p>Blakely was born in Ecclesall, Sheffield, to a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/">Scottish</a> father and an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/irish-news/">Irish</a> mother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His parents separated when he was young and his mother then married a man named Humphrey Wyndham Cook in 1941.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blakely was educated at Shrewsbury and became interested in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/motorsport/">motor racing</a> at a young age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his beloved HRG racing car, he took second place at Brands Hatch on Boxing Day 1954 and went on to have even greater success.</p>



<p>During the period spanning 1951-1953, he came in 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/silverstone/">Silverstone</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/goodwood-racecourse/">Goodwood</a>. </p>



<p>However, Blakely’s career was cut short after a brief relationship with the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/26956232/glam-killer-hanged-uk-shooting-cheating-boyfriend-dead/">soon-to-be murderer Ruth Ellis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Killed by his girlfriend</strong></h2>



<p>Ruth was a nightclub manager, who worked in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/london/">West London</a> after moving the British capital from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/berkshire/">Berkshire</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She had survived a tough upbringing, where she had been abused by her dad which forced her to leave home at a young age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruth had a baby at the age of 18 and worked as an escort, before becoming a nightclub manager and making making numerous celebrity friends.</p>



<p>Blakely started dating Ruth in 1953, but their relationship quickly became strained and extremely volatile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The racecar driver was physically abusive to his new girlfriend and even caused her to have a miscarriage in 1955, after a particularly violent incident.</p>



<p>On Easter Sunday that same year, Ruth took a taxi to find Blakely while armed with a revolver. </p>



<p>Upon seeing the racer, she jumped out of the taxi and fired six shots at him. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After killing her ex-partner, Ruth asked Blakely’s friend a simple question: &#8220;Will you call <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/police/">the police</a>, Clive?&#8221;</p>



<figure id="attachment_32116747" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32116747" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/newspress-collage-9evtbpt7t-1733337697254.jpg?1733401763&amp;strip=all&amp;w=960" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32116747" width="960" height="640" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32116747" class="wp-caption-text">Ruth will be played by Lucy Boynton in the ITV drama A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ruth in court</strong></h2>



<p>In court at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/court/">the Old Bailey</a>, Ruth wore a fitted black suit and had her hair dyed platinum blonde.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked if she meant to kill Blakely, she said: &#8220;It&#8217;s obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ruth was convicted of murder within twenty minutes of the jury deliberating and was later executed on July 12, 1955.</p>



<p>In the days leading up to her hanging, Ruth wrote to Blakely’s parents and said that she will “die still loving” their son.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her death was extremely controversial and kickstarted a national conversation which led to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6851753/when-was-death-penalty-abolished-in-the-uk/">abolition of capital punishment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A cruel love</strong></h2>



<p>Ruth’s incredible story and violent romance will be explored in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a> drama A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nightclub manager will be played by Lucy Boynton and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32116711/dci-davies-detective-ruth-ellis-case-who/">DCI Davies</a>, the man who caught Ruth, will be played by Joe Armstrong.</p>



<p>Fans can catch the series, which will star as Blakely, when it debuts in 2025.</p>

<p>They were then asked to rank the importance of 23 specific genital characteristics, including smell, tightness and <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/10042202/normal-vagina-different-types-labia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labia size</a> (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening). </p>



<p>It was found men didn&#8217;t prioritise appearance as highly as functional and sensory aspects.</p>



<p>Attributes rated more important included physical pleasure, smell, taste, tightness, and lubrication, which suggested men focus more on functional experiences than aesthetic considerations, such as symmetry and labia size. </p>



<p>Around a fifth of the study&#8217;s participants reported negative views, which indicated a small minority of men harbour unfavourable attitudes towards female genitals.</p>



<p>The participants who rated their overall perceptions as moderately positive also agreed with statements such as &#8220;Women&#8217;s genitals are beautiful&#8221; and &#8220;Women should feel proud of their genitals&#8221;. </p>



<p>Another finding from the study was a link between men&#8217;s attitudes and their behaviour in sexual and relational contexts. </p>



<p>Men who held positive views were more likely to engage in behaviours related to intimacy and confidence in their female partners, such as giving positive verbal feedback about their genitals. </p>



<p>Those with negative attitudes were more likely to provide critical feedback. </p>

<p>Men with more positive views were also reported having a greater number of lifetime female sexual partners.</p>



<p>Study author E. Sandra Byers, professor emerita at the University of New Brunswick, told <a aria-label="PsyPost (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psypost.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PsyPost</a>: &#8220;Most, but not all men who are attracted to women have positive (though not very positive) views of female genitals.</p>



<p>&#8220;Holding negative views likely reflects societal messages about female genitals and may influence not only men&#8217;s own but also their female partners&#8217; sexual well-being.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Previous studies have found&#8230;</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(15)00540-2/abstract" target="_blank" aria-label="2015 study (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">2015 study</a> of 1,847 men from across the US, aged 18 to 80, also found men weren&#8217;t particular about the appearance of female genitalia. </p>



<p>Participants in the study had to rate images depicting small, medium, and large labia as attractive, neutral, or unattractive. </p>



<p>Small and medium labia were generally preferred over a large labia. </p>



<p>But 36 per cent of participants remained neutral towards all three sizes. </p>



<p>When directly asked about their preferences, 54 per cent said they had no preference. </p>



<p>And when it came to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/sex/" target="_blank" aria-label="sexual pleasure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual pleasure</a>, 60 per cent said it wasn&#8217;t impacted by appearance. </p>



<p>Byers said they&#8217;re now in the process of writing up findings relating to men&#8217;s genital self-image.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20">


			<div>
<p>A healthy vagina varies from person to person in many ways, including the colour, shape and size. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth looking out for the following signs of symptoms that could indicate a health issue: </p>
<ul>
<li>A change in the colour, odour or amount of vaginal discharge</li>
<li>Vaginal redness or itching</li>
<li>Vaginal bleeding between periods, after sex or after menopause</li>
<li>A mass or bulge in the vagina</li>
<li>Pain during intercourse</li>
</ul>
<p>You might not need to see your GP, particularly if you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with a vaginal yeast infection in the past and you&#8217;re experience similar symptoms. </p>
<p>But if your symptoms don&#8217;t go away after using medication that you get from a pharmacy, speak to your doctor. </p>
<p>Things you can do to keep your vagina healthy include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Be sexually responsible &#8211; use condoms or maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who&#8217;s free of sexually transmitted infections. If you use sex toys, clean them after every use.</li>
<li>Get vaccinated &#8211; vaccinations can protect you from HPV, the virus associated with cervical cancer, as well as hepatitis B — a serious liver infection that can spread through sexual contact.</li>
<li>Do Kegel exercises &#8211; kegel exercises can help tone your pelvic floor muscles if you have prolapse, leaking of urine or weakness of the pelvic floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trainer said in a statement given to <a href="https://www.irishracing.com/news/Fastorslow-ruled-out-for-season/252587" target="_blank" aria-label="Irishracing.com (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Irishracing.com</a>: &#8220;Following the John Durkan Chase, Fastorslow suffered a soft tissue injury.</p>



<p>“Before he resumed back into full work, we had him checked over by our veterinary team. They have advised us that he requires time off so he will miss the remainder of this season.</p>



<p>“It is not career threatening and we expect that he will be back for the resumption of the 2025/26 season.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fastorslow had been among the favourites to challenge for this year&#8217;s Cheltenham Gold Cup.</p>



<p>He and two-time Gold Cup king Galopin Des Champs have enjoyed several almighty bust-ups, notably at Fastorslow&#8217;s beloved Punchestown.</p>



<p>But he was flat there when running in last month&#8217;s John Durkan, won by current Gold Cup fav Fact To File.</p>



<p>His price hardened into 5-2 for the big race on the back of the Fastorslow news.</p>



<p>Trainer Willie Mullins has made no bones about how much he loves the JP McManus-owned seven-year-old, who won the Brown Advisory in March.</p>



<p>There were also nibbles for Galopin Des Champs into 3-1 to complete a hat-trick in the Friday feature.</p>



<p>Fastorslow was sent off 8-1 for last year&#8217;s Gold Cup but unseated at the 16th fence when travelling well under regular jockey JJ Slevin.</p>



<p>He bounced back from that when downing Galopin Des Champs in the Punchestown Gold Cup last May.</p>



<p>Fastorslow was sent off 6-4 fav for the star-studded John Durkan but failed to pick up over the final two fences.</p>

<p>A NEW multiview feature debuted last night on Peacock&#8217;s coverage of the Premier League.</p>



<p>The American broadcaster offered fans the opportunity to watch four games at once on a split screen.</p>

<p>The feature allows fans to choose which game&#8217;s audio to listen to.</p>



<p>While it also makes it easy to switch between matches.</p>



<p>Viewers also possess the option to focus in one game in particular, should they wish to.</p>



<p>The multiview feature allowed fans to watch <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196654/manchester-city/">Manchester City</a> vs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1225889/nottingham-forest/">Nottingham Forest</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/newcastle/">Newcastle</a> vs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196657/southampton/">Southampton</a> vs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196660/chelsea/">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196662/everton/">Everton</a> vs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1226009/wolverhampton-wanderers/">Wolves </a>at the same time.</p>

<p>Peter Drury and former Gunners defender <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/lee-dixon/">Lee Dixon</a> were on the call for that match.</p>



<p>Multiview will be available again to viewers this Saturday.</p>



<p>Fans will be able to keep across <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1225644/brentford/">Brentford</a> vs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196669/newcastle-united/">Newcastle</a>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196666/crystal-palace/">Crystal Palace</a> vs Manchester City and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196670/aston-villa/">Aston Villa</a> vs Newcastle at the same time.</p>

<p>While a second gushed: &#8220;Is MultiView new on Peacock?!? Because this is f***ing awesome, soooo much better than Goal Rush.&#8221;</p>



<p>A third added: &#8220;This Peacock multi view thing is actually cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>Multiview was already an option for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nfl/">NFL</a> viewers in the States.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youtube/">YouTube</a> TV enables subscribers to watch as many as four games at once during its Sunday Ticket coverage.</p>

<p>PREMIER League fans have been warned of an unexpected £1,000 fine landing on their doorstep &#8211; even if they&#8217;re streaming over an Amazon Fire Stick.</p>



<p>Fixtures are currently being shown live on Amazon Prime Video. </p>

<p>Customers can stream nearly all Prime content with a Prime subscription alone. </p>



<p>But that is unfortunately not the case when live events are involved.</p>



<p>To watch any live event as it is broadcast in the UK, you need to have a TV Licence.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not just for the footy, but for all live television as it is aired &#8211; even if it is streamed over the internet. </p>



<p>That even includes live content on apps like YouTube. </p>



<p>This week&#8217;s Premier League fixtures, being broadcast from 3 to 5 December, could cost you £1,000 if you&#8217;re watching them via Prime Video without a TV licence.</p>



<p>That is the maximum amount you can be fined for watching live content without paying for a TV Licence. </p>



<p>The maximum fine is £2,000 in Guernsey.</p>



<p>Not only is it a hefty fine you&#8217;re risking, but a day in court as well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this rule applies to all live matches, including when the teams play on Boxing Day (26 December).</p>



<p>A similar <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/27507364/netflix-tv-licence-rules-fine-live-paul-vs-tyson/" target="_blank" aria-label="warning was issued to Netflix subscribers keen to watch the live Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson boxing match (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">warning was issued to Netflix subscribers keen to watch the live Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson boxing match</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The match was watchable live through Netflix &#8211; though many UK customers did not realise they could fall foul of TV Licensing rules. </p>



<p>A TV licence costs £169.50 a year and covers you if you are watching or downloading programmes through any TV app.</p>



<p>You might not need to, but you can get a TV licence to cover you if your screen is black and white &#8211; it costs £57.</p>



<p>&#8220;You could be prosecuted if we find that you have been watching, recording or downloading programmes illegally. The maximum penalty is a £1,000 fine plus any legal costs and/or compensation you may be ordered to pay,&#8221; TV Licensing says.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have a database of approximately 31million licensed and unlicensed addresses. This tells us if your address has a TV Licence.</p>



<p>&#8220;All our visiting officers have access to this database. This means they can check if you have a licence or not. </p>



<p>&#8220;If you tell us that you do not need a TV Licence, our officers may still visit you to confirm this.&#8221;</p>

<p>TULISA Contostavlos won&#8217;t appear in the I&#8217;m A Celebrity final and is already on a flight out of Australia, The Sun can exclusively reveal.</p>



<p>The singer, 36, has kept a low profile since being the third campmate to be evicted from the show.</p>



<figure id="attachment_32130541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130541" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/i-need-time-tulisa-breaks-954394443_bf0898.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=610" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130541" width="610" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130541" class="wp-caption-text">Tulisa is on her way home from Australia</figcaption></figure>



<figure id="attachment_32130549" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32130549" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tulisa-contostavlos-evicted-camp-im-953993146_785073.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=670" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32130549" width="670" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32130549" class="wp-caption-text">The N-Dubz star moments after being voted out of the jungle</figcaption></figure>



<p>She snubbed an appearance on spin-off show, Unpacked, the day after her elimination, and there have been reports of a big bust-up with her friend Michelle McKenna, who is in <span id="e2aa403c-1aef-4636-a9ad-180a92299b47" class="suggested-link">Australia</span> to support her.</p>



<p>Today <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32121424/tulisa-breaks-silence-blazing-row/">Tulisa posted on social media</a> insisting there was no issue with Michelle, but she <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32117155/tulisa-friends-panicking-im-a-celeb-elimination/">isn&#8217;t hanging around </a>to catch up with her campmates.</p>



<p>A source said: &#8220;She&#8217;s already left <span id="270fb743-0bfc-435e-bbef-98f82ca9071d" class="suggested-link">Australia</span> so won&#8217;t be returning to camp for the final episode. </p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on a flight out of the country now. It&#8217;s all a bit sudden but <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/itv/">ITV</a> were told today she&#8217;s left the country.&#8221;</p>



<p>Usually, I&#8217;m A Celeb stars stay put at the JW Marriott hotel in Surfers Paradise until the winner in crowned and there is a big wrap party to celebrate.</p>



<p>But Tulisa has opted out and decided to return home early. It follows her being a no show when campmate <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melvin-odoom/">Melvin Odoom</a> arrived back at the <span id="00a24faf-2ebe-4493-b0a9-e28b1b2085b2" class="suggested-link">luxury</span> hotel. </p>



<p>Fellow stars <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jane-moore/">Jane Moore</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/dean-mccullough/">Dean McCullough</a> were on hand to greet him.</p>



<p>Tulisa cryptically hinted at &#8220;fake campmates&#8221; in her post-show interview with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/lorraine/">Lorraine</a> Kelly but didn&#8217;t name names. </p>



<p>Eyebrows were raised when <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/tulisa/" rel="">Tulisa</a> appeared on Lorraine looking unimpressed.</p>



<p>The following day she took to social media to tell fans she was &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; with all the messages she&#8217;d received since leaving the jungle.</p>

<p>There were then reports that Tulisa was angry about the way her pal Michelle had handled her social channels while she was on the show.</p>



<p>But responding to the headlines, Tulisa hit back: &#8220;Absolutely no issue with my sis&#8217;s posts.</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t argued with my best mate in over 10 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;We literally don&#8217;t have arguments, they don&#8217;t exist in our world. Only love.&#8221;</p>



<p>She went on to add: &#8220;Same with my bro. That&#8217;s what makes us so strong and my soul fam so special to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;But leave my Shelly and Dan alone pls x.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FRIENDLY FIRE</h2>



<p>Michelle, who greeted <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32068173/im-a-celebrity-tulisa-third-campmate-evicted/" rel="">Tulisa when she was evicted from camp</a>, hasn&#8217;t been seen with the former <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> judge since.</p>



<p>It is believed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31817944/im-a-celebrity-tulisa-reveals-real-name/" rel="">Tulisa</a> was particularly upset by Michelle posting about having a free dinner with her partner Daniel Johnson once Tulisa was out.</p>



<p>A source told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14157717/Truth-Tulisa-screaming-Jungle-absence-deleted-Instagram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a>: &#8220;They were only in Australia because of Tulisa. </p>



<p>&#8220;It felt like they were revelling in the situation and taking liberties on her kindness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Michelle and Daniel were there, on a trip funded by ITV and only because of Tulisa. </p>



<p>&#8220;They were there because of her and she trusted them with her social media.</p>



<p>&#8220;When she got out of the jungle and saw what had been put on there, she was upset and it prompted a huge row. </p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help but think that seeing her friends living it up like that while she was roughing it in the jungle must have really annoyed her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a source told us: &#8220;Tulisa and the two friends who came to&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;with her disappeared after she came out.</p>



<p>&#8220;No one saw her in the hotel and she wasn’t talking to anyone.</p>

<figure id="attachment_32121636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32121636" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tulisa-contostavlos-evicted-camp-met-953992673_64e3b2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-32121636" width="640" height="960" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32121636" class="wp-caption-text">Tulisa has now said that she and Michelle &#8216;don&#8217;t argue&#8217; and haven&#8217;t done so in 10 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;Her mates were talking among themselves and were worried as no one could pin her down.</p>



<p>&#8220;They were chatting back and forth in their group chats and no one could raise her. It was total <span id="59dfe280-0081-41ac-8852-f75c3bf23fe4" class="suggested-link">radio</span> silence.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BREAKING SILENCE</h2>



<p>Following Tulisa&#8217;s axe on Monday night, the<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32117155/tulisa-friends-panicking-im-a-celeb-elimination/" rel=""> singer went silent for 24 hours</a> before resurfacing and speaking out.</p>



<p>She posted: &#8220;I&#8217;m just doing a little video to clear a couple things up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just so you know, when I came out of the jungle, I felt fine first of all and then that evening my friends went to bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;But because it&#8217;s been a while for me I can get overwhelmed quite easily.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just started to feel overwhelmed. I thought do you know what, I really just need to take a bit of time for me and just chill.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s okay to feel a little bit overwhelmed. I&#8217;ve been out of the spotlight for a long time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still trying to overcome those things. I&#8217;ve still got my little demons.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to go hide under a rock for the&nbsp;next&nbsp;10 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;It means I just need a little bit of time to just process and get right with my thoughts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Tulisa continued: &#8220;Also, I just want to clarify <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32096035/tulisa-speaks-out-im-a-celeb-campmate-fake/" rel="">I do not think any of my campmates are fake</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was having a conversation with Lorraine and what I was trying to say was typical me thinking out loud.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone in there is going to have one or two individuals that they are way more close with than others.</p>



<p>&#8220;When we get out, is when you are really going to see those friendships get nurtured and really become your friends for life.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m friends with everyone. I love my jungle buddies, I love my jungle fam.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there are going to friendships that people have that really, really get nurtured and become friends for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>TIM Shaw is a mega car enthusiast as well as being a well-known presenter on radio and TV.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/motors/11810216/who-fifth-gear-presenter-tim-shaw/">the face of Car SOS alongside Fuzz Townshend</a> for many years, viewers are curious to know more about Tim&#8217;s love life. Here&#8217;s what we know.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is Tim Shaw&#8217;s wife?</h2>



<p>Tim is married to Hayley Shaw and together they share two daughters. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/31473032/veteran-car-enthusiasts-chitty-bang-magic-1901-mors/">car enthusiast</a> married Hayley in 1999, but they marriage has not been without its ups and downs.</p>



<p>The couple made headlines in June 2005 when Hayley sold Tim&#8217;s beloved <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/30916686/ultra-rare-lotus-esprit-sale/">Lotus Esprit</a>, for just 50p on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ebay/">Ebay</a>.</p>



<p>The car was worth a whopping £25K, and by selling it, Mrs Shaw knew it would hit her car loving husband where it hurts.</p>



<p>Hayley was fuelled to sell the sports car after her husband joked live on air with glamour model <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jodie-marsh/">Jodie Marsh</a> that he would leave his wife and two children for her.</p>



<p>After hearing this joke on <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/28895617/five-music-channels-all-shut-down-kerrang-4music/">Kerrang!</a>, Hayley immediately placed the expensive motor on the auction site at the &#8220;buy it now&#8221; price of 50p.</p>



<p>The item description read: &#8220;I need to get rid of this car in the&nbsp;next&nbsp;two to three hours before my husband gets home to find it gone and all his belongings in the street.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am the registered owner and I have the log book.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please only buy if you can pick up tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the car was snapped up and sold within five minutes.</p>



<p>At the time Hayley told The Birmingham Post: &#8220;When he said he would leave me and the kids for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jodie-marsh/">Jodie Marsh</a>, that was it for me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;He has two daughters. One of them goes to school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am sick of him disrespecting his family for the sake of his act.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe it was childish but I had a few drinks that night and I thought I would get him back the best way I could&#8221;, explained Mrs Shaw.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/sheffield/">Sheffield</a> on June 9, 1974, Tim Shaw is a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31823342/kemi-rodgers-im-a-celebrity-unpacked-host/">radio host</a> and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/32097839/paddy-mcguiness-replaces-gregg-wallace-on-inside-the-factory/">TV presenter</a>.</p>



<p>However, Hayley&#8217;s husband was training to be an engineer long before he landed himself a job in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/">broadcasting</a>.</p>



<p>Tim kicked off his career when he began hosting a show on Kerrang! in 2004.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t become a familiar face on TV until he snapped up the job of being a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/24962347/fifth-gear-host-jason-plato-net-worth/">Fifth Gear</a> <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/24879984/fifth-gear-presenter-tiff-needell/">presenter</a> on the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/channel-5/">Channel 5</a> show in 2008.</p>



<p>On April 23, 2008, Tim was dismissed from Kerrang radio as a result of an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/ofcom/">Ofcom</a> investigation into the running of an on-air competition.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/31840014/im-a-celeb-ofcom-exempt-trial/">Ofcom</a> found that Tim had rigged the competition in order to award his friend with two tickets to a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/rolling-stones/">Rolling Stones</a> documentary.</p>

<p>As well as hosting <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/29889690/jonny-smith-fifth-gear-car-presenter-late-break-show/">Fifth Gear</a> in 2009, Tim is best known for hosting National Geographic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/28923199/iconic-sports-car-car-sos-fuzz-townshend/">CAR SOS</a> between 2013 and 2023 alongside good pal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.ie/motors/12452278/fuzz-townshend-mechanic-wife-net-worth/">Fuzz Townsend</a>.</p>



<p>In the show they wear disguises to surprise classic car owners who’ve fallen on hard times, before helping them to restore their <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/motors/">motors</a>.</p>



<p>Tim previously opened up to The Sun about how much&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.ie/motors/707571/car-sos-star-shares-tips-on-tv-success-top-gears-failings-and-how-to-make-viewers-cry-for-all-the-right-reasons/">he loves doing the show</a>.</p>



<p>He told us: “It’s the best feeling ever, to give the cars back to someone deserving. To put a smile back on a petrolhead’s face.”</p>

<p>The talented artist, who received her second cancer diagnosis earlier this year, was part of duo Wee Papa Girl Rappers with her sister Sandra.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/music/" rel="">hit song</a> Wee Rule reached number six in the UK singles chart in 1988 and was a major hit across Europe.</p>



<p>A statement from the family said: &#8220;It is with great sadness that we announce that beloved sister and mother Samantha Lawrence passed away on Sunday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Samantha, aka TY Tim, was known for her chart success with Wee Papa Girl Rappers, a hip-hop pop duo that she founded with her older sister Sandra Lawrence, aka Total S.&#8221;</p>



<p>DJ Dave Pearce, who worked with the duo, said: &#8220;Sam was part of a defining and groundbreaking era of trailblazing British female rappers who against the odds conquered the UK charts alongside the likes of Cookie Crew.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a really exciting time for me and always a pleasure to work with them on my Radio London hip-hop show back in the day, their positive energy was infectious.</p>



<p>&#8220;Always keen to experiment, they fused dancehall with reggae with Wee Rule and stepped into the house arena courtesy of Kevin Saunderson&#8217;s remix of Heat It Up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Through her success, Sam will have inspired others to follow their dreams. I&#8217;m glad I had the chance to remind her of that recently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thoughts with her sister Sandra and daughter KeeKee. Rest In Peace.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sisters were born in Hammersmith, west London, and brought up in South Ealing and Acton.</p>



<p>They released two albums and split up in 1991 before reuniting for further work.</p>



<p>A fan wrote on X: &#8220;Very sad news to read. My condolences to Ty Tim&#8217;s family and friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another said: &#8220;A great example of Brit urban music. Rest in peace Samantha.&#8221;</p>



<p>The family has asked for privacy &#8220;at this devastatingly sad time&#8221;.</p>

<p>The deaths were all recorded within just two weeks, between November 10 and 25 in the Kwango province, situated in the Southwest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p>



<p>Health Minister Roger Kamba <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32122961/urgent-update-mystery-flu-killed-congo/" rel="">confirmed in a press conference today</a> that local authorities have verified 71 deaths and 382 cases.</p>

<p>He made a desperate plea for medical supplies and international aid to deal with the unfolding crisis.</p>



<p>A civil society leader, Cephorien Manzanza, said that the situation was &#8220;extremely worrying&#8221;.</p>



<p>Manzanza told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/unknown-disease-kills-143-southwest-congo-local-authorities-say-2024-12-03/" target="_blank" aria-label="Reuters (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>: “Panzi is a rural health zone, so there is a problem with the supply of medicines.”</p>

<p>It also said it was working alongside DRC&#8217;s public health ministry to further investigate.</p>



<p>The DRC recently had an outbreak of an <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/7237256/monkeypox-symptoms-treatments/">ultra-deadly strain of mpox </a>which was declared by the WHO as a global public health emergency.</p>



<p>The highly contagious disease killed at least 500 people and infected 13,700 during an initial outbreak this year.</p>



<p>And in 2019 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9529909/ebola-epidemic-congo-health-emergency/">deadly Ebola epidemic in Congo</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 1,600 people was declared an international health emergency.</p>



<p>The WHO confirmed the crisis at the time after a case of the virus was found in a city of 2 million people.</p>
