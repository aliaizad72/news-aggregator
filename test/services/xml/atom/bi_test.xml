All affected employees have been notified and are receiving transition support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each of our brands faces distinct market opportunities and challenges. As you know, the pace of change is accelerating for media businesses and it is essential to our success that we continuously evaluate how and where we invest to serve our audiences best to advance the long term health of our business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In particular, the ways audiences are interacting with our Thrillist and PS brands have changed and we must adapt. Going forward, Thrillist will be operated by Eater, on a similar model to Punch, leveraging shared leadership and resources. PS will concentrate on its extensive footprint across social and video platforms with an even stronger emphasis on shopping. Eater is reorganizing its cities coverage into a regional model in order to most efficiently serve its audience&amp;#39;s needs. The Product and Media Production &amp;amp; Technology organizations are being restructured to meet the current needs and scale of the business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throughout our history, we&amp;#39;ve led the digital media landscape because we&amp;#39;ve been willing to adapt and evolve as technology and the way people consume content change. These actions, while difficult, are consistent with our strategic priority to deepen audience connections to the brands and franchises that drive loyalty while ensuring our financial strength. As was the case this year, in 2025 we will continue to invest in our business where we see the clearest opportunities: editorial and user experiences that build loyal, direct audiences; a high-value advertising proposition based on unique intellectual property; strong brands that command audience attention; leading multimedia productions like we&amp;#39;re building with the Vox Media Podcast Network; and consumer-direct businesses to diversify revenue streams and grow recurring revenue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While our focus on improving our financial strength is always a priority, this year we have made meaningful progress to ensure our long-term profitability. This has meant difficult decisions and ongoing financial discipline about where we&amp;#39;re investing and where we&amp;#39;re pulling back. To our departing colleagues, I&amp;#39;m grateful for your contributions. To everyone at Vox Media, thank you for your continued commitment to our work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a developing storyâ€¦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/vox-media-lays-off-staff-at-lifestyle-brands-thrillist-eater-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

A former Pentagon official who&amp;#39;s a leading China hawk. A former top rival for the GOP presidential nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are some of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the options President-elect Donald Trump and his allies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;are &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-mulls-replacing-pete-hegseth-with-florida-gov-ron-desantis-8f682ad2&#34;&gt;reportedly considering&lt;/a&gt; for defense secretary as allegations and character concerns cloud his unconventional pick to lead the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/hegseth-trump-defense.html&#34;&gt;said to have been surprised&lt;/a&gt; by allegations that have emerged about his pick, Pete Hegseth. The former&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fox News host and Trump confidant has faced &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25364429-hegseth_2017_police_report/&#34;&gt;accusations&lt;/a&gt; of sexual assault, &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history&#34;&gt;financial mismanagement&lt;/a&gt; at the veteran&amp;#39;s advocacy group he led, excessive alcohol use, and belittling behavior toward women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations have complicated the Army veteran&amp;#39;s chances at confirmation even in a GOP-controlled Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pentagon-chief-pete-hegseth-world-views-ukraine-china-2024-11&#34;&gt;Hegseth&lt;/a&gt; has said the sexual encounter, which happened in 2017, was consensual. He was not charged with a crime in relation to the incident. He has slammed media coverage of the allegations as &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;BS&amp;#34; and has said he will not &amp;#34;back down.&amp;#34; In an op-ed published Wednesday, he said the growing scrutiny was a &amp;#34;textbook manufactured media takedown.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the piece, which was shared by the Trump transition team, Hegseth wrote that he is looking &amp;#34;forward to an honest confirmation hearing, not a press show trial based on anonymous accusations.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/5aaad86842e1cc1be811a08f?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;913&#34; width=&#34;1400&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Pete Hegseth Donald Trump interview&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Then-President Donald Trump is interviewed by Fox &amp;amp; Friends cohost Pete Hegseth at the White House.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hegseth met with lawmakers at the Capitol this week to discuss plans for the defense department, address the mounting misconduct allegations against him, and shore up congressional support, even by promising not to drink alcohol if they&amp;#39;ll confirm him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his meeting with the embattled defense secretary-designate went well, adding that Hegseth laid out &amp;#34;a big vision for how to fix the problems&amp;#34; at the department, CNN &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-musk-ramaswamy-doge-12-5-24/index.html&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. He didn&amp;#39;t say whether he would support Hegseth&amp;#39;s nomination, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Republican senators offered mixed reactions, ranging from continued uncertainty to full-fledged support. But even if the political winds shift in Hegseth&amp;#39;s favor, many reports have said that Trump is already considering other potential nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-mulls-replacing-pete-hegseth-with-florida-gov-ron-desantis-8f682ad2&#34;&gt;broke&lt;/a&gt; the news the president-elect was considering replacing Hegseth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Other names that various sources within Trump world have floated include former Pentagon official Elbridge Colby and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This country&amp;#39;s full of talented people,&amp;#34; Kori Schake, director of Foreign and Defense Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, told Business Insider. &amp;#34;The Secretary&amp;#39;s main job is dealing with Congress, since they control most of defense policy. So generally someone who&amp;#39;s had legislative experience is a huge advantage.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names being floated would potentially be politically safer choices with much more experience in government. Their experience and stature could make them more independent of an incoming White House that prizes loyalty, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Trump will drop Hegseth, who is showing no intention at the moment to withdraw as the nominee on his own. Hegseth said Thursday he met with Trump and that he &amp;#34;fully supports&amp;#34; him, but ABC News reports the president-elect isn&amp;#39;t working the phones to try to save him like he did &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-gaetz-withdraws-attorney-general-consideration-2024-11&#34;&gt;Matt Gaetz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back-up options wait in the wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;95432d37-9148-4d28-a9fe-a5d5def33e9e&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;95432d37-9148-4d28-a9fe-a5d5def33e9e&#34;&gt;Former political rival Gov.

That&amp;#39;s compared to 1-day, 1-park tickets, which start at $104 for non-peak dates and can reach over $200 for peak dates like the week of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tickets at the lower pricing tier are now available for reservations from January through March. It is unclear whether the promotion will continue beyond March, but it has been discontinued and reinstated several times since the park stopped offering a lower-price annual pass for Southern California residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promotional rate comes as the Anaheim theme park faces criticism over its large crowds and long wait times. In August, the Disney fan publication Inside The Magic reported wait times at the Princess Pavilion in Fantasyland, where guests can greet actors dressed as their favorite characters, skyrocketed to 300 minutes and that the sheer volume of guests at the park was &amp;#34;beyond manageability.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said its California-based theme parks saw increased guest spending and attendance growth at the beginning of 2024 but had less favorable results in the second quarter. By the third quarter, operating income at Disney&amp;#39;s domestic parks and experiences was down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;editor-rtfLink&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/epic-universes-opening-could-benefit-walt-disney-world-cfo-2024-11&#34;&gt;Hugh Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, the company&amp;#39;s chief financial officer, said Disney&amp;#39;s Experiences sector &amp;mdash; which includes its theme parks and cruise ships &amp;mdash; had a &amp;#34;slight moderation in demand&amp;#34; during the company&amp;#39;s third-quarter earnings report. The report said the Experiences sector&amp;#39;s operating income decreased 3% to $2.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;But overall, I would just call this as a bit of a slowdown that&amp;#39;s being more than offset by the Entertainment business,&amp;#34; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;editor-rtfLink&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-bob-iger-ceo-diet-exercise-workout-routine-leadership-management-2024-11&#34;&gt;CEO Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt; said the company&amp;#39;s Experiences sector rebounded during its latest earnings call in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;In domestic, we certainly feel like the consumer is strengthening,&amp;#34; Iger said. &amp;#34;As I mentioned earlier, we obviously saw growth in domestic parks and certainly feel very positively about that. And that&amp;#39;s our expectation going forward, is a gradual strengthening in the consumer.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney recently unveiled a series of new rides for Disneyland. During the D23 event in August, Disney said it is adding &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;editor-rtfLink&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-world-villain-theme-park-2024-8&#34;&gt;new attractions&lt;/a&gt; based on Marvel and that the Avengers Campus would be expanding. Disneyland will also build new attractions based on James Cameron&amp;#39;s Avatar franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/disneyland-southern-california-ticket-tier-returns-locals-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It&amp;#39;s designed to mitigate the effects of turbo lag and quicken the response of its auto start/stop system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My test car boasted EPA fuel economy figures of 23 mpg city, 33 mpg highway, and 26 mpg combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The CLE450 drives beautifully, dispatching velvety smooth acceleration on demand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750a20942b4e52d2f5332de?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;4284&#34; width=&#34;5712&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;The front cabin in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE450 4Matic Coupe.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The CLE Coupe&amp;#39;s front cabin.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLE450 delivers on its promise as a world-class grand tourer. The car is well-balanced with responsive steering. The suspension is set up more for comfort than outright cornering ability. But it remains a calm and collected customer in the twisty bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turbocharged straight-six is smooth, dialing up near-instantaneous acceleration through its slick-shifting 9-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel-drive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mild hybrid system performed as expected, effectively filling in any holes in the engine&amp;#39;s torque and smoothing the traditional harshness of an auto start/stop system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mercedes, the 375 horsepower CLE450 can run from 0 to 60 mph in an impressive 4.2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The coupe&amp;#39;s interior is elegantly styled with a beautifully integrated suite of cabin tech.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750a6d942b4e52d2f533413?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3000&#34; width=&#34;4000&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Four photos show the front dash, center console, center stack, and panorama roof in the 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE450 4Matic Coupe.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The CLE450 Coupe&amp;#39;s cabin.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLE&amp;#39;s cabin borrows heavily from the current C-Class. Its interior is an elegant blend of modern design and callbacks to classic Mercedes-Benz of days gone by, like the giant 11.9-inch touchscreen sitting below the trio of vintage turbine-design air vents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material and build quality are excellent. However, I was not a fan of the shiny piano black lacquer Mercedes chose for the center console, which is highly susceptible to unsightly smudges and scratches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint with the CLE&amp;#39;s interior is the lack of physical controls. While the touchscreen and capacitive touch-sensitive buttons are modern and sleek, they feel imprecise and are clumsy to use, especially while driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The focal point of the front dash is an 11.9-inch infotainment screen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750a90c42b4e52d2f5334d4?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;1500&#34; width=&#34;4000&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Four photos show the 11.9-inch touchscreen in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE450 4Matic Coupe, which features YouTube, sudoku, drive modes, and a surround-view camera.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The CLE infotainment screen.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CLE has the third-generation Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system.

The system&amp;#39;s overeager voice assistance is also far less intrusive than in past iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen is also home to the surround-view camera system along with a host of additional capabilities like YouTube video streaming and games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The car comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;In front of the driver is a stylish three-spoke steering wheel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750a7acef9a5d904789eb16?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;1500&#34; width=&#34;3000&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Three photos show the steering wheel and digital instrument display in a 2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE450 4Matic Coupe.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The CLE450&amp;#39;s steering wheel and instrument display.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a traditional gauge cluster, the CLE has a 12.3-inch digital display.

They were the cheapest option by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cupcakes were noticeably smaller than the rest, but if they&amp;#39;d been the only option, I don&amp;#39;t think I would&amp;#39;ve thought they were small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the kids unanimously agreed these were the most visually appealing and that they&amp;#39;d choose to eat them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed fair considering these cupcakes had the most sprinkles in the most vibrant colors compared to the ones from Wegmans and Publix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The kids loved the Walmart cupcake.

The buttercream frosting was light, airy, and perfectly sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also agreed the cake was also the most moist and flavorful of the ones we tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The icing didn&amp;#39;t extend all the way to the edge of the cupcake, which made it look like it came from a more &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/red-flags-how-to-spot-good-bakery-from-pastry-chef&#34;&gt;high-end bakery&lt;/a&gt;.

Their flavor was good, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The Publix cupcakes seemed pretty balanced.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/673e03a4192f525898599497?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;2272&#34; width=&#34;3029&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Vanilla cupcake with white frosting and sprinkles from Publix&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;I really liked the look of the Publix cupcakes.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Elliott Harrell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publix&amp;#39;s frosting wasn&amp;#39;t as light as Wegmans&amp;#39; frosting, but it wasn&amp;#39;t as overly sweet as Walmart&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cake was also fairly moist and had more notes of vanilla than Walmart&amp;#39;s, but wasn&amp;#39;t as flavorful as Wegmans&amp;#39; version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;For the occasion and the price, Walmart was the winner &amp;mdash;otherwise, I&amp;#39;d choose Publix.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/673dfbeeede4eeae39289641?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3375&#34; width=&#34;4500&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Three vanilla cupcakes with white frosting and rainbow sprinkles one from Wegmans, Publix, Walmart on plate&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;From left to right: A cupcake from Wegmans, Publix, and Walmart.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Elliott Harrell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we adults thought Wegmans&amp;#39; cupcakes were the best, I didn&amp;#39;t think they were worth the high price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-aldi-birthday-party-unique-ideas-2020-2&#34;&gt;child&amp;#39;s birthday&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ll probably stick to the Walmart cupcakes since they were the least expensive and the clear kids&amp;#39; favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adult birthdays or celebrations, I still wouldn&amp;#39;t pick Wegmans. The price is just too high for me to justify buying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;#39;d go for Publix cupcakes, which are almost as good and less than half the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cupcakes-from-grocery-store-comparison-review-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Some conservative personalities argued that the new aesthetic abandoned &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/jaguar-history-cars-james-bond-rebranding-controversy-woke-2024-11&#34;&gt;Jaguar&amp;#39;s heritage&lt;/a&gt; and pushed into &amp;#34;woke&amp;#34; politics, while others questioned why the promo video didn&amp;#39;t feature any cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first phase of &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/jaguar-rebrand-successful-controversy-marketing-advertising-woke-2024-12&#34;&gt;Jaguar&amp;#39;s rebrand had some advertising veterans divided&lt;/a&gt; on whether the strategy was a smart move for the iconic brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that division carried through to &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/jaguar-releases-concept-car-after-controversial-rebranding-campaign-woke-2024-12&#34;&gt;Jag&amp;#39;s latest update on Monday, which finally paired images of cars&lt;/a&gt; with its &amp;#34;exuberant modernism&amp;#34; vision. Now that concept cars are connected to the initial rebranding video, some marketing professionals are praising Jaguar&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;brilliant&amp;#34; strategy &amp;mdash; and others are less convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/673e3b69ede4eeae3928aa72?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;4500&#34; width=&#34;8000&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;jaguar PR photo showing models walking in pink desert&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jaguar&amp;#39;s video ad, released in November, features models in colorful, modern clothing, and doesn&amp;#39;t show any cars.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Jaguar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Jaguar&amp;#39;s paced unveiling is a brilliant strategy to keep people talking and interested in a highly competitive auto marketplace,&amp;#34; Jim Heininger, the founder and principal of Chicago rebranding firm The Rebranding Experts, told Business Insider after seeing the conceptual car rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This is a masterclass in what rebranding can accomplish for a company &amp;mdash; a new forward-facing product and brand, clearly designed for its new customer persona, that everyone is talking about,&amp;#34; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heininger &amp;mdash; whose 30-year career includes work for P&amp;amp;G, McDonald&amp;#39;s, and Anheuser-Busch &amp;mdash; argued that Jaguar set high expectations when it debuted its controversial rebrand last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the concept car unveiling delivered on those expectations. The car effectively signals the company&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;boldly modernistic&amp;#34; vision and &amp;#34;departure from the past,&amp;#34; he said. The colors, design shapes, and new logo &amp;#34;feel right when you see it on the concept car.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/674e28b67929f317fb4fa1f8?format=jpeg&#34;

said Anderson, who worked for brands such as Google, Levi&amp;#39;s, Burberry, and Axe before joining Bailey Lauerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;They have revealed much more than a concept car,&amp;#34; he said. &amp;#34;It seems it is the beginning of the story of the Jaguar brand vision, which they can easily chapter out and stretch to the production model reveal.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But looking to the future, Andersen said the company&amp;#39;s strategy has to remain well-executed when it comes time to reveal its new EV, which the company has said it expects to happen in late 2025 before hitting showrooms in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I think the biggest risk for them now is making sure the production model lives up to the promise and doesn&amp;#39;t suffer death by a thousand cuts,&amp;#34; Andersen told BI. &amp;#34;Rolling out an unapologetic, future-facing brand along with a marginally better car might not go so well.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;5bf4107e-b8c8-45d5-9f22-8038e795be62&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;5bf4107e-b8c8-45d5-9f22-8038e795be62&#34;&gt;The proof of success will be in the production model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, not all of the ad veterans who spoke to BI had so much praise for Jaguar and its rebranding rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christos Joannides, founder and creative director of luxury branding agency Flat 6 Concepts in Los Angeles, told Business Insider that Jaguar&amp;#39;s initial rebranding announcement did too much all at once, &amp;#34;overwhelming and confusing&amp;#34; the carmaker&amp;#39;s long-standing audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, in releasing its concept car this week, Jaguar didn&amp;#39;t do enough to ground its new ethos in reality, Joannides said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joannides &amp;mdash; who has worked with Jaguar competitors like Maserati and Lotus &amp;mdash; argued that the concept car&amp;#39;s features, like the rear with no window and the brass-toned divider running through the middle of the cabin, are impractical and bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/674e2b9de45a68623a2779d6?format=jpeg&#34;

Joannides said. &amp;#34;As it stands, the concept car feels superficial and gimmicky, like a desperate attempt to be different without any real substance or coherent strategy.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joannides said that while Jaguar&amp;#39;s initial teaser video was &amp;#34;certainly audacious,&amp;#34; the final product will be what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Brandon Taylor, founder and CEO at UK-based brand consultancy firm Brandon, told BI that while Jaguar&amp;#39;s rebrand was a smart play in some ways because it got everyone talking, it still has a long time before the first production model comes out to try to maintain that buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Why they&amp;#39;ve left a year between concept and car is beyond me &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;that is a dangerous strategy to play,&amp;#34; said Taylor, who has worked with brands like Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, and Kimberly-Clark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunny Bonnell, the cofounder and CEO at strategic branding firm Motto, said that to hold the audience&amp;#39;s attention until the new cars hit the market, Jaguar needs to dive deeper into the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; behind the rebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;What does &amp;#34;Copy Nothing&amp;#34; mean in practice?&amp;#34; said Bonnell, who has worked with brands like Google and Virgin. &amp;#34;How will it shape the driving experience, not just the look?&amp;#34; To do that, Jaguar needs a storytelling narrative, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cde8a390-44b1-4ed3-827c-2a5cb87f2e47&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;cde8a390-44b1-4ed3-827c-2a5cb87f2e47&#34;&gt;Jaguar&amp;#39;s next steps in its rebranding rollout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unclear which specific design elements of the new concept will be implemented in Jaguar&amp;#39;s forthcoming electric vehicle models. Jaguar said its concept car was &amp;#34;an indicator of design philosophy and intent for the coming new vehicles,&amp;#34; which are expected to be available for purchase sometime in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new EV model will use dedicated Jaguar Electric Architecture, have a projected driving range of up to 430 miles on a single charge, and be able to add up to 200 miles of range after 15 minutes of rapid charging, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the new EVs are expected to be much more upscale than previous Jags. Though Jaguar has not confirmed a price range, &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/jaguar-finally-reveals-its-all-electric-type-00/&#34;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; reported, without citing a source, that the new Jag could likely cost at least $127,000 &amp;mdash; a significant increase from current average prices of around $70,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We have forged a fearlessly creative new character for Jaguar that is true to the DNA of the brand but future-facing, relevant, and one that really stands out,&amp;#34; Jaguar managing director Rawdon Glover said of Monday&amp;#39;s concept debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: December 5, 2024 &amp;mdash; This story has been updated with comments from two additional marketing veterans. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/jaguar-strategy-new-model-rebranding-reviewed-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

A suspect, identified from surveillance footage, was last seen in Central Park on Wednesday morning, the police said. The NYPD is offering a $10,000 reward for tips leading to the gunman&amp;#39;s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manhunt continued into Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750bf2bef9a5d904789f1fb?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;647&#34; width=&#34;863&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;NYPD Security cam footage of a suspect&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The suspect was wearing a black hoodie.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Courtesy of NYPD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ee6623b7-f972-478b-ae67-34adcadbcbac&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;ee6623b7-f972-478b-ae67-34adcadbcbac&#34;&gt;Shooter was &amp;#39;proficient in the use of firearms,&amp;#39; police said&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, said in a statement, &amp;#34;We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him,&amp;#34; the statement said. &amp;#34;We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian&amp;#39;s family and all who were close to him.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYPD&amp;#39;s chief of detectives, Joseph Kenny, said at the press conference that the shooter arrived on 6th Avenue about five minutes before Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The shooter steps onto the sidewalk from behind the car. He ignores numerous other pedestrians, approaches the victim from behind, and shoots him in the back,&amp;#34; Kenny said. &amp;#34;The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenny added that the shooter&amp;#39;s weapon appeared to jam during the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;From watching the video, it does seem that he&amp;#39;s proficient in the use of firearms, as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,&amp;#34; Kenny said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A law-enforcement source with knowledge of the matter told BI that the surveillance footage showed a hooded gunman dressed in black with a gray backpack initially&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;opening fire from about 20 feet behind Thompson as the CEO walked in the direction of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;He definitely knew where he was going to be,&amp;#34; the source said of the shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/67509cb17929f317fb4ff5b7?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3024&#34; width=&#34;4032&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Crime scene in front of the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;UnitedHealth Group canceled its investor day shortly after reports of the shooting broke.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Paul Squire/ BI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law-enforcement source, who is not authorized to talk to the press, said the gun appeared to be equipped with a silencer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police said officers found Thompson unconscious and unresponsive two minutes after the shooting. Emergency responders rushed him to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:12 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3fa4b05e-1cd2-40bd-afe7-d3ed14714f70&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;3fa4b05e-1cd2-40bd-afe7-d3ed14714f70&#34;&gt;Police have not identified a motive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting occurred blocks from Midtown holiday tourism landmarks, including Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center, whose Christmas tree lighting took place Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late Wednesday morning, six evidence cups remained on the taped-off section of the sidewalk where the shooting happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;That&amp;#39;s covering the shell casings,&amp;#34; an officer at the scene told BI, declining to give their name because they were not authorized to talk to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group canceled its &amp;#34;investor day&amp;#34; conference shortly after reports of the shooting broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenny said investigators were combing through Thompson&amp;#39;s social media and interviewing employees and family members and would be talking to law enforcement in Minnesota, where Thompson lived and where UnitedHealth Group and UnitedHealthcare are based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson&amp;#39;s wife, Paulette Thompson, told &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/unitedhealthcare-ceo-fatally-shot-brian-thompson-rcna182805&#34;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; in an interview that her husband had been receiving threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Basically, I don&amp;#39;t know, a lack of coverage?&amp;#34; she said. &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police department in his hometown of Maple Grove, Minnesota, told BI it hadn&amp;#39;t been notified of any threats he might have received. Theresa Keehn, the Maple Grove police administrator, initially said Maple Grove had no record of calls for service to his house, but the department later said it had responded to a 2018 call from Paulette Thompson. An incident report said she had been walking to bed when she saw the front door deadbolt turn and grew afraid someone was inside the house. The police did not find anyone inside the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unnamed senior law enforcement official &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna182975&#34;&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/bullets-unitedhealthcare-ceo-cryptic-notes-brian-thompson-deny-defend-depose-2024-12&#34;&gt;shell cases found at the scene&lt;/a&gt; were inscribed with the words &amp;#34;deny,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;defend,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;depose.&amp;#34; BI has not independently confirmed the description of the evidence, and an NYPD spokesperson didn&amp;#39;t immediately return a request for comment Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay M. Feinman, an author and legal professor who specializes in insurance law, torts, and contract law, wrote a similarly titled book &amp;#34;Delay Deny Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don&amp;#39;t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is dubbed an expose of insurance injustice and explains how people can be more careful when shopping for insurance policies and what to do when pursuing a disputed claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYPD said Thompson arrived in New York City on Monday and was staying at a hotel across the street from where he was shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/67509d98ef9a5d904789e7f6?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3024&#34; width=&#34;4032&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Crime scene evidence in front of Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The police marked evidence at the scene of the shooting.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Laura Italiano/BI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;76b7bffb-5878-47b4-9095-db2db934d748&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;76b7bffb-5878-47b4-9095-db2db934d748&#34;&gt;Thompson was remembered as a &amp;#39;hardworking Midwest guy.&amp;#39;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson spent 20 years at UnitedHealth Group and served as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the health-benefits unit, since April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While announcing his promotion, the company said Thompson would &amp;#34;drive continued growth across the global, employer, individual, specialty, and government benefits business while continuing the company&amp;#39;s focus on ensuring access to high-quality, affordable healthcare.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/brian-thompsons-fatal-shooting-industry-leaders-react-2024-12&#34;&gt;Leaders in the healthcare industry&lt;/a&gt; shared their condolences in the hours after Thompson&amp;#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth&amp;#39;s shares were broadly unchanged after the shooting. They&amp;#39;ve gained about 12% in the past 12 months, less than the 32% increase in the S&amp;amp;P 500 but outperforming competitors including CVS Health, Humana, and Elevance Health. During its third-quarter results in October, it gave what UBS called a &amp;#34;more conservative than usual&amp;#34; outlook for fiscal 2025. Ahead of Wednesday&amp;#39;s investor day, it gave more detailed guidance for next year, forecasting revenue of $450 billion to $455 billion and adjusted earnings of $29.50 to $30 a share. The company also suffered a &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/infamous-hacker-gang-pharmacy-prescription-backlogs-2024-2&#34;&gt;ransomware &lt;/a&gt;attack that disrupted pharmacy deliveries earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Wednesday afternoon, UnitedHealth Group had removed the names of its executives from its website, an archived version of its site shows. Some executives also appeared to have deleted their LinkedIn profiles, though it&amp;#39;s not clear when they did so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson had previously served as CEO of the group&amp;#39;s government programs, running its programs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnesota&amp;#39;s governor, Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said in a statement on the social-media site X that the shooting death was &amp;#34;horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Minnesota is sending our prayers to Brian&amp;#39;s family and the UnitedHealthcare team,&amp;#34; Walz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson&amp;#39;s former brother-in-law, Bassel El-Kasaby, told Business Insider that Thompson was &amp;#34;a good guy, very successful and very humble &amp;mdash; just a decent, hardworking Midwest guy.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Whoever did this is a coward and a loser,&amp;#34; El-Kasaby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: December 4, 2024 &amp;mdash; An earlier version of this story misstated Thompson&amp;#39;s work history at United Health. He worked at the company for 20 years but was not an executive there for 20 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update December 5, 2024: This story was updated as the manhunt continued.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/unitedhealthcare-insurance-division-ceo-shot-dead-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>I became a mom at 16, and my daughter at 18. I&#39;ve been raising kids for almost 45 years.</title>

And, as times have changed, limiting screen use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lena Bradley, 62, a nursing assistant and student from New York. It has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of my three daughters got pregnant at 18. Family circumstances meant &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/grandparents-are-raising-teenage-grandkids-retirement-different-expectations-2024-11&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;d raised my grandson&lt;/a&gt;, Kvion, 14, from infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been raising his sister, Kylnn, 10, for four years. As their grandma, I didn&amp;#39;t hesitate to step in because it was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/where-are-they-now-16-and-pregnant-2018-9&#34;&gt;After getting pregnant at 16&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ve been raising kids for four and a half decades. It&amp;#39;s been longer than that because I babysat my younger siblings while my mom worked full-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always enjoyed having my apartment full of people, but as I&amp;#39;ve gotten older, it&amp;#39;s become more of a challenge. It&amp;#39;s noisy all the time and, now I&amp;#39;m in my sixties, I often crave some peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;698f7fd0-6f32-4e87-b633-2abe1cb3b2c6&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;698f7fd0-6f32-4e87-b633-2abe1cb3b2c6&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting older all the time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main difficulties is my stressful job as a part-time nursing assistant in the intensive care unit at a hospital. I&amp;#39;m also in college studying gerontology. I&amp;#39;m always looking to better myself, and once I qualify, I hope to work as a social worker for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, I&amp;#39;m getting older myself. I &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/turmeric-could-help-osteoarthritis-knee-pain-small-study-finds-2020-9&#34;&gt;have arthritis in my knees.&lt;/a&gt; My grandkids like to ride about on bikes and scooters. This time of year, they want to go ice skating at Rockefeller Center or in Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/6750d6697929f317fb500b45?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;563&#34; width=&#34;750&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A woman in a black top sitting in a restaurant.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bradley said she is blessed to be raising her grandkids.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Courtesy of Lena Bradley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often ask me about my methods for raising children. I&amp;#39;m all about &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/authoritative-parenting-can-help-raise-confident-and-independent-kids-2020-11&#34;&gt;consistency and structure&lt;/a&gt;. It worked for me when I cared for my family at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apply the same techniques with my grandchildren. We all sit down together for scheduled, regular meals. We interact and ask about each other&amp;#39;s day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;b4318cc9-b974-4aff-9516-9d708697498d&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;b4318cc9-b974-4aff-9516-9d708697498d&#34;&gt;My reward is seeing my grandkids safe and happy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, times have changed since my kids were little. Technology is everywhere. My grandson and youngest daughter, Johnia, 19, who lives with us, aren&amp;#39;t allowed to bring their phones to the table. The kids&amp;#39; electronics are switched off by 9 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I satisfy their needs, but they&amp;#39;ll earn some other stuff by helping with chores. Meanwhile, my reward is seeing this new generation safe and happy. They&amp;#39;re such a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is knowing I&amp;#39;m &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/boomers-retirement-loneliness-making-friends-lifesaver-solutions-epidemic-happiness-2024-3&#34;&gt;unlikely to be lonely in later life&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I&amp;#39;m not getting me time, and I won&amp;#39;t be jetting off somewhere by myself. My me time is going to the bathroom and having that bathroom to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn&amp;#39;t have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have an interesting story to share with Business Insider about your role as a grandparent or being raised by a grandparent?

I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for UnitedHealthcare did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a potential link between the shooting and a coverage-denial issue. Paulette Thompson couldn&amp;#39;t be reached by BI for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words on the cases are similar to the title of a 2010 book, &amp;#34;Delay Deny Defend,&amp;#34; which is subtitled, &amp;#34;Why Insurance Companies Don&amp;#39;t Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the book, Jay M. Feinman, a legal professor who specializes in insurance law, torts, and contract law, declined a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are still searching for the shooter. Authorities have described the killing as a &amp;#34;targeted attack.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson was gunned down at about 6:45 a.m. outside the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan. The shooter fled the scene before police arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare is the largest private insurer in the US, and Thompson was in New York for an investor meeting when he was killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#34;investor day&amp;#34; event was then canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/bullets-unitedhealthcare-ceo-cryptic-notes-brian-thompson-deny-defend-depose-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

she told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;Jeggings had their moment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/67460ad7ede4eeae3929b01c?format=jpeg&#34;

With a global population of 2,682 as of April 2024, this represents around one in 15 billionaires, or roughly 6.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outflow of billionaires between 2020 and 2024 was most pronounced in Eastern Europe, where there was a net outflow of 29 billionaires, likely reflecting ultrarich citizens leaving the region amid the &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-ruble-dollar-currency-putin-ukraine-war-economy-inflation-military-2024-11&#34;&gt;conflict between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central and South America, Oceania, and Southeast Asia also saw net outflows of billionaires, UBS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, billionaires have been moving to countries including &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/moving-us-to-switzerland-better-quality-of-life-staying-abroad-2024-9&#34;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the UAE, &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/chef-runs-fine-dining-restaurant-out-of-public-housing-apartment-2024-10&#34;&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Middle East and Africa region has also attracted new billionaires, with individuals with a combined &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-gain-rich-list-billionaires-nvidia-huang-meta-zuckerberg-buffett-2024-9&#34;&gt;net worth of over $400 billion&lt;/a&gt; moving to the region in the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS notes that one driving factor behind the superrich relocating is the increased value of good healthcare in the post-pandemic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The shock of the pandemic put a premium on first-class healthcare,&amp;#34; the report&amp;#39;s authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;As a group, billionaires are ageing, and their families are growing. Naturally, healthcare and education become more important.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another driver, UBS said, is moving to &amp;#34;jurisdictions where legal structures support wealth transfer.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, living in a place where the transfer of wealth through inheritance and other means is not subject to high levels of taxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;People are relocating to jurisdictions not just for tax benefits, but also for safety and political reasons,&amp;#34; one American billionaire told the authors of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I moved several years ago with my family to a country, state and city that affords the benefits most seek,&amp;#34; the unnamed billionaire added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Unless &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-twitter-facebook-political-polarization-mechanism-2022-10&#34;&gt;the political divide&lt;/a&gt; addresses failed policies that have yet to curb crime, lack of rule of law and safety, as well as fostering an economic climate that unleashes potential, I fear the trend will continue.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaires also value locations that support business &amp;mdash; especially with &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-sets-new-average-daily-losses-record-in-ukraine-uk-2024-12&#34;&gt;geopolitical tensions remaining elevated globally&lt;/a&gt;, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to UBS, total billionaire wealth rose by 121% worldwide from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion between 2015 and 2024. At the same time, the number of billionaires grew from 1,757 to 2,682. This number peaked in 2021, when there were 2,686 &amp;mdash; and has flatlined since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-emigrating-covid-19-pandemic-lockdown-wealth-ubs-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Yang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yu had a long career as a lawyer, during which he published several works of fiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He pivoted to writing full time after getting staffed on the HBO series &amp;#34;Westworld.&amp;#34;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Yu&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;first love&amp;#34; was literature, but before he became a novelist and showrunner, pragmatism led him down another path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate, Yu pursued a pre-med track with a minor in creative writing at the University of California, Berkeley. After he &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/learning/rejected-from-medical-school&#34;&gt;failed to get into medical school&lt;/a&gt;, Yu flirted with a job in finance. Eventually, he settled on a career in law &amp;mdash; practical, but something that played to his literary sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/8-of-the-most-impressive-people-to-attend-columbia-law-school-2016-8&#34;&gt;Columbia Law School&lt;/a&gt; grad worked as a lawyer for the next 13 years with stints at the top firm Sullivan &amp;amp; Cromwell LLP and the electronics company Belkin. All the while, he stayed creatively busy, &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-i-published-bestseller-first-book-2022-8&#34;&gt;publishing three books&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;#39;d written in his downtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about where the mortgage payment was coming from, so I could just write when I got to write,&amp;#34; Yu told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, Yu balanced his career and his passion. By 2014, he came to a crossroads when a major opportunity came his way: He was offered a staff writer position on the hit HBO sci-fi series &amp;#34;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/westworld-timeline-spoilers-2018-4&#34;&gt;Westworld&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#34; He had to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yu&amp;#39;s choice led him to where he is now, a decade later, as the showrunner of the Hulu series &amp;#34;Interior Chinatown&amp;#34; &amp;mdash; based on the &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/learning/national-book-award-fiction-longlist-2021&#34;&gt;book of the same name&lt;/a&gt; that Yu, incidentally, also wrote. The high-concept comedy, which boasts &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/taika-waititi-next-goal-wins-thor-star-wars-interview-2023-11&#34;&gt;Taika Waititi&lt;/a&gt; as an executive producer, follows Willis Wu (Jimmy O. Yang), a background character in a police procedural who desperately wants to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yu spoke with BI about what convinced him to take that leap from law to TV and how he built up his writing career while maintaining a high-demand full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/674f9012e45a68623a27af10?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;4000&#34; width=&#34;5333&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Jimmy O.

Yang as Willis Wu in episode four of &amp;#34;Interior Chinatown.&amp;#34;&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Mike Taing/Hulu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you got staffed on &amp;#34;Westworld,&amp;#34; you had a pretty lengthy law career. How did you balance writing with working?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changed every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My then fiancÃ©e, now wife, was very understanding and patient and knew that I had this passion. So before we had kids, especially, there was enough time to write. It got trickier after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a demanding job. The thing about it, though, especially with writing, is that I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to be a film director. I wasn&amp;#39;t a saxophonist. I could practice my thing in the car, in a cafÃ© for 30 minutes, lunch even. Scribbling a few things down, it felt like a good refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you conceptualize the two kinds of work? Was it like, &amp;#34;I have a vocation, and I have a career?&amp;#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I liked the way you framed it. I mean, it was a vocation. I had a career, and that was my livelihood. I did not think of writing as a viable livelihood up until literally the moment it became my job through TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s easy in hindsight to sort of make the path seem smoother or more deliberate than it was. Honestly, there were moments where I had doubts about both sides of it: &amp;#34;How can I get out of this law career, &amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;ll never really know what I can do?&amp;#34; and the other side just like, &amp;#34;Am I wasting my time?&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I struggled with that a lot, because a lot of days, nothing productive came out. That feels terrible, you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you got staffed on &amp;#34;Westworld,&amp;#34; were you deliberately trying to move away from law and into TV at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came about over the course of a few years. I had a book agent already. He&amp;#39;s not my current agent, but he hooked me up with a film and TV rights agent at United Talent Agency. They, at first, represented me for just rights to my fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think, maybe partly because I live in LA and partly because I showed some interest, I got to meet executives and producers and see if there was anything in addition to my books and short stories that I might want to pitch to them &amp;mdash; or just to develop a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a couple of years, I got a little bit more comfortable with that, and I started to think about writing scripts. I actually wrote a terrible pilot based on one of my own ideas. I mean, it&amp;#39;s truly terrible. My agents were probably really &amp;mdash; I mean, I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;d seen it before, but they were like, &amp;#34;Yeah, we maybe don&amp;#39;t send that out.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they did send it out. They sent it to a couple of people, I think, that were very kind and patient. And I started to think about maybe doing that. I didn&amp;#39;t think about staffing on someone else&amp;#39;s show, which is ultimately how I got that call and got staffed on an HBO show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I threw my hat in the ring, and over the course of two, three years, I somehow found my way onto a list and was able to get a job interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made it feel like a viable career move at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things. One, health insurance. That was very important to my wife, especially at the time. We still have two kids. We had just moved into a new house, and we&amp;#39;d moved a little bit out of LA to Orange County, but we had a mortgage, and we needed health insurance. So it was like, &amp;#34;Can you get that?&amp;#34; And I could, thanks to the Writers&amp;#39; Guild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And two, it felt like the kind of thing you would take a leap for. It was a sold series, so I knew I would have at least six months of guaranteed employment at this show. I definitely didn&amp;#39;t take for granted that I would get another job after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite honestly, I&amp;#39;m pretty risk-averse. But I think it was just the nature of this opportunity, a real decision point. I couldn&amp;#39;t do both, obviously. I couldn&amp;#39;t be in a writers&amp;#39; room and be practicing law. So that was when I finally took the leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did keep my bar license active for a few years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your writing experience eventually inform &amp;#34;Interior Chinatown&amp;#34;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I wanted to write something a bit more personal, not that I&amp;#39;d shied away from it before. It just felt like there was something in me that wanted to talk about this story, about this family, in a more direct way than I had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willis is not me, but I think there was an internal pressure to want to write about this family as a kind of fantasy or alternate-reality version of how my parents talked about their lives and people in their community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/674f9026e45a68623a27af18?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;2000&#34; width=&#34;2667&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;Ronny Chieng and Jimmy O.

I actually thought it would be pretty hard to film, and it turned out it was!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when they did approach me, I was amazed, but I sort of immediately had this feeling of like: &amp;#34;Oh, how am I going to do this? This is going to be tricky.&amp;#34; And they knew, too; Hulu understood the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think despite that on the surface-level it looks like a script, that it is a script, the trick would be figuring out how to translate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#34;Interior Chinatown&amp;#34; is now streaming on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://affiliate.insider.com?h=4b049efd4300c73fcd2813e2732eb998f3bf3dcd4b319808cca6b2a38a41bfb7&amp;amp;postID=67477b98d4b5ffeb6fed7efd&amp;amp;postSlug=leaving-law-for-tv-writing-interior-chinatown-charles-yu-interview-2024-12&amp;amp;site=bi&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwelcome&#34; data-autoaffiliated=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/leaving-law-for-tv-writing-interior-chinatown-charles-yu-interview-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The report found that 42% of all respondents and 52% of CEOs reported working in a toxic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, people were &amp;#34;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/rage-apppliers-think-twice-before-leaving-jobs-expert-2023-1&#34;&gt;rage applying&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34; for jobs, angrily scrolling through job ads when they were fed up. Revenge quitting is similar, with the added vengeance of moving on to something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;143de02f-b879-4129-817b-ac8fc4690de7&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;143de02f-b879-4129-817b-ac8fc4690de7&#34;&gt;Stretched too thin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Hood, the founder and CEO of the leadership and management training platform Verosa, told BI that employee dissatisfaction &amp;#34;rarely stems from a single event.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s often a gradual erosion of &amp;#39;intrinsic motivators&amp;#39; such as connection, meaning, and safety,&amp;#34; Hood said. &amp;#34;When these motivators are left unmet, resentment and detachment can grow, eventually leading to employees walking away, often in frustration or as a way of reclaiming control.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday-Quinn, who has worked in senior roles at Citi and PwC, said employees have reported being stretched thin, due to cuts and heavier workloads, made worse by the &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-managers-great-flattening-organization-meta-tech-layoffs-firing-2023-3&#34;&gt;attack on middle managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Dissatisfaction has been quietly brewing,&amp;#34; Holliday-Quinn said, with a period of layoffs and RTO mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;This disconnect between leadership and the workforce isn&amp;#39;t just a communication issue,&amp;#34; she said. &amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s a retention crisis waiting to happen.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generational dynamics are also at play, with Gen Zers being skeptical about &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-might-kill-middle-management-2023-11&#34;&gt;climbing the corporate ladder&lt;/a&gt; for little payoff. Younger workers are &amp;#34;less willing to tolerate outdated workplace cultures or rigid hierarchies,&amp;#34; said Holliday-Quinn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;Companies that don&amp;#39;t adapt to these expectations will struggle to retain the next wave of talent,&amp;#34; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ab83e910-2e7e-4274-b31a-ecdfe2684999&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;ab83e910-2e7e-4274-b31a-ecdfe2684999&#34;&gt;How to prepare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrington told BI that company leaders need to be trained to have crucial conversations with their direct reports because &amp;#34;most team members leave a manager, not a company.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Businessolver report found that while 55% of CEOs believe they lead with empathy at work, only 28% of employees actually agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrington said listening goes a long way, as does filtering down information from above effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m a really big believer in investing in leaders really is investing in the company as a whole,&amp;#34; she said. &amp;#34;Because if they&amp;#39;re doing their job, they&amp;#39;re going to be working on the individual team member engagement, retention, and motivation.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrington said if an employee has been treated with empathy and felt heard in their current role, they&amp;#39;re more likely to help with the transition or stay longer to meet deadlines during their notice period rather than being checked out and unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;You&amp;#39;re much more likely to get that really helpful and good transition,&amp;#34; Harrington said. &amp;#34;Which will help massively with business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For others, though, &amp;#34;revenge quitting&amp;#34; could impact them greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;2025 is shaping up to be a wake-up call for employers,&amp;#34; Holliday-Quinn said. &amp;#34;Those who have relied on control over connection or ignored the mounting dissatisfaction within their teams are about to face the consequences.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/2025-could-trigger-a-wave-of-revenge-quitting-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

I&amp;#39;ve always been someone who needs sunshine and warmth in my bones, so when winter rolls around each year, I plan a sun-soaked getaway to escape the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve traveled to more than 50 countries and have come across a few destinations offering a winning combination of stunning scenery, memorable experiences, and &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/unique-warm-places-to-visit-for-holiday-season-2018-12&#34;&gt;warm weather&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are four places I&amp;#39;d recommend checking out in the &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/best-states-to-visit-in-winter-season-us&#34;&gt;winter months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;slideshow&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;The Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, is sunny practically all year round.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/671a7ac8a0a0cc14f2239e58?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3456&#34; width=&#34;4608&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A view from Burleigh Head National Park overlooking Palm Beach and Currumbin on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Burleigh Head National Park is a great place to catch ocean views on the Gold Coast in Queensland.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Kevin Hellon/Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With beautiful beaches and plenty of theme parks, the Gold Coast in &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/mistakes-people-make-visiting-australia-first-time-from-local-2024-7&#34;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Queensland is filled with things to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gold Coast has a sub-tropical climate with about 300 days of sunshine a year, so you&amp;#39;re likely to encounter optimal weather for outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite activity here was walking the trail from Tallebudgera Creek to Burleigh Heads, which goes through Burleigh Head National Park. I witnessed plenty of scenic ocean views along the way and often stopped to watch the surfers catch a wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;If you have any interest in monkeys, Ubud in Bali, Indonesia, is the place to go.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/671a8caa9b3250dbbce9d814?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3748&#34; width=&#34;4997&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A temple at the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Visiting the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary was one of the highlights of our trip to Ubud.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Flash Vector/Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If chill island vibes, monkey spottings, and melodious insect cacophonies appeal to you, Ubud is the place to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the top attractions is the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, home to more than 1,200 monkeys. You can explore ancient temples and meet the local long-tailed macaques in their natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure you follow the rules and don&amp;#39;t take any food or water bottles with you. I learned that lesson the hard way when one enormous monkey leaped on my backpack, giving me the fright of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another highlight for me was sitting on our veranda at the Green Field Hotel while overlooking the rice fields at sunrise and listening to the cricket orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 8-year-old son and I sat out there one morning for about two hours while everyone else was asleep, chatting and enjoying the sounds of nature around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a nice, easy nature hike, check out Campuhan Ridge Walk. I loved the scenery and took my 4-year-old with me. At one point, we stopped for a rest on the trail, and I looked up to find the biggest spider I&amp;#39;d ever seen lurking right above us &amp;mdash; so keep your eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;Bonito, Brazil, is an incredible snorkeling destination.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/671a8a0a01ea6d83dee3d43f?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3149&#34; width=&#34;4199&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A clear river surrounded by greenery and a wooden porch in Bonito, Brazil.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The clear rivers in Bonito are a great place to spot fish.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Gustavo Castellon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonito, which means &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; in Portuguese, lives up to its name. The town is in the southern region of the Brazilian Pantanal, the world&amp;#39;s largest tropical wetland. We stopped here on our way from Rio de Janeiro to Bolivia and fell in love with this hidden paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by lush forests, Bonito has amazing crystal-clear rivers where you can spot an abundance of fish while snorkeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our trip, a massive thunderstorm rolled in above us when we were snorkeling. Watching the fish dart around underwater as raindrops landed on my back was such an awe-inspiring experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;I loved exploring wineries and beaches in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/671a8c099b3250dbbce9d7b9?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;3071&#34; width=&#34;4095&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A vineyard in Grand Constantia Wine Estate in Cape Town, South Africa.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;We enjoyed a delicious lunch and wine tasting at Groot Constantia in Cape Town.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;GTW/Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to epic coastal scenery, warm people, delicious food, and historical sites, Cape Town delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of our favorite spots was Groot Constantia, the oldest wine estate in &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/mistakes-avoid-south-african-safari-first-timers-2024-7&#34;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. We had a mouth-watering lunch and did a wine tasting before learning about the history of Cape farmers at the Manor House Museum and walking through the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cape Town&amp;#39;s sun-soaked beaches were also postcard-perfect. The water can be pretty chilly, however, even in the summer. I only dipped a toe in, but if you enjoy a little cold-water therapy, feel free to dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/best-warm-travel-destinations-according-to-frequent-traveler&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Influencers and other affiliate marketers drove 20% of Cyber Monday e-commerce revenue</title>

That&amp;#39;s a roughly 7% year-over-year increase from 2023, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-money-with-affiliate-marketing&#34;&gt;Affiliate linking&lt;/a&gt; is a marketing strategy where a figure of influence, such as a TikTok star or a product-review writer at Wirecutter, shares an item and earns a commission if someone buys it via a referral link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe Analytics found that products promoted via an affiliate link were six times as likely to lead to a purchase compared to content posted on social media by a brand or user that did not contain an affiliate-marketing or comparable promotional link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that professional product endorsers are more effective at driving sales than other social-media users, Taylor Schreiner, a senior director at Adobe Digital Insights, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re bombarded with information from all sorts of different channels, and people are finding that a recommendation from another brand they trust, be it an individual or a broader one, is of a lot of value to them in this attention-sapped environment,&amp;#34; Schreiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affiliate marketing has become an increasingly important tactic for driving e-commerce sales as more consumers, and young shoppers in particular, turn to bloggers and other digital creators to decide what to buy. Fifty-two percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said their purchase decisions were influenced by social-media creators either somewhat or very often, per a &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://chart-na1.emarketer.com/265683/frequency-with-which-purchase-decisions-of-us-adults-influenced-by-social-media-influencers-by-age-dec-2023-of-respondents&#34;&gt;YouGov survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-become-an-amazon-influencer-what-it-pays&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart, and &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/ltk-weapon-against-affiliate-competition-from-youtube-shopping-tiktok-2024-7&#34;&gt;LTK&lt;/a&gt; have spent years building affiliate programs to compensate creators who drive sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTK cofounder and president Amber Venz Box told BI that the company&amp;#39;s creator partners were &amp;#34;able to earn a commission on pretty much every product that they&amp;#39;re talking about, featuring, and using in their own lives.&amp;#34; LTK said its creators &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/how-creators-influencers-make-money-in-social-commerce-ltk-2021-12&#34;&gt;drive billions in retail sales&lt;/a&gt; annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social shopping has generally been on the rise this year, as platforms like TikTok introduce more robust e-commerce features, including live shopping.

Online spend for the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday reached â€¯$41.1 billion.

Pierre Vandier, NATO&amp;#39;s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, shared the development with &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2024/12/03/nato-draws-up-plans-for-its-own-fleet-of-naval-surveillance-drones/&#34;&gt;Defense News&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the outlet his team was in the early stages of establishing the drone fleet, but aimed to launch it before a NATO summit next June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vandier compared the concept to police CCTV cameras that are mounted on streetlights in high-crime areas to capture evidence of criminal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;The technology is there to make this streetlighting with USVs,&amp;#34; he said, using the acronym for uncrewed surface vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vandier added that the goal was that &amp;#34;NATO can see and monitor its environment daily,&amp;#34; especially across the Baltic and Mediterranean seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development comes after several incidents of critical underwater infrastructure being damaged or severed over the last three years, with Russia sometimes suspected of being behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, a series of underwater explosions in the Baltic Sea rendered two Nord Stream gas pipelines, designed to transport gas from Russia to Germany, inoperable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://nautiskinformation.soefartsstyrelsen.dk/details.pdf?messageId=b86dcca2-9cf0-4977-af7b-da4072d4fb99&amp;amp;language=da&#34;&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.aklagare.se/en/media/press-releases/2024/february/the-prosecutor-closes-the-swedish-investigation-concerning-gross-sabotage-against-nord-stream/&#34;&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/nordstream-172.html&#34;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; authorities launched investigations and concluded that the incident was an act of sabotage. Denmark and Sweden closed their investigations due to a lack of evidence or jurisdiction, while Germany is continuing its probe and says it has &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/generalbundesanwalt-jens-rommel-zur-terrorgefahr-es-gibt-keinen-grund-zur-entwarnung-a-1d3e761c-80fc-45fc-84e0-2f93a74ab533&#34;&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; two suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, two undersea fiber-optic communication cables were also damaged in the Baltic Sea, in a suspected act of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cables included a 135-mile internet link between Lithuania and Sweden&amp;#39;s Gotland Island, and a 730-mile cable carrying data between Germany and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NATO official told&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-secret-sub-unit-menaces-undersea-cables-2024-9&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in September that threats to subsea infrastructure, including oil and gas pipelines and data cables, had increased since the start of Russia&amp;#39;s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO has since taken steps to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructure and prepare for any disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a NATO-EU&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2024/08/28/reinforcing-resilience-natos-role-in-enhanced-security-for-critical-undersea-infrastructure/index.html&#34;&gt;task force&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the resilience of critical infrastructure in January 2023, established an infrastructure coordination&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_211919.htm&#34;&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in February 2023 to map vulnerabilities, and set up the Maritime&amp;nbsp;&lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://mc.nato.int/media-centre/news/2024/nato-officially-launches-new-nmcscui&#34;&gt;Center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure this May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO is also &amp;#34;stepping up patrols,&amp;#34; Commander Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO&amp;#39;s Allied Maritime Command, told Reuters this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the drone fleet, Vandier didn&amp;#39;t specify the types of USVs or their overall number, but said that the US is already using a similar concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Navy &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3645647/task-force-59-launches-new-unmanned-task-group-591/&#34;&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; Task Group 59.1 in January to test and deploy uncrewed systems to improve maritime security in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;So somehow it&amp;#39;s not very risky,&amp;#34; Vandier said, adding that &amp;#34;everything is known and sold, so it is much more a matter of adoption than technology.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO&amp;#39;s Allied Command Transformation&amp;#39;s Public Affairs Office didn&amp;#39;t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-planning-fleet-sea-drones-protect-underwater-infrastructure-critical-sabotage-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

He pledged in 2006 to donate about 85% of his Berkshire Class A shares to five foundations: the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation (named after his late wife), and three foundations run by his three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He teamed up with Bill and Melinda Gates in 2010 to form The Giving Pledge, an initiative that asks the world&amp;#39;s wealthiest people to dedicate the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. Buffett himself has &lt;a href=&#34;https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=177&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; that 99% of his wealth will go to philanthropy during his lifetime or upon his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, the shares he&amp;#39;s already given away were worth about $50 billion based on their value at the time of donation, or about $130 billion given Berkshire Hathaway&amp;#39;s stock value at the time. If Buffett had kept those shares rather than donating them, he&amp;#39;d likely be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-stock-philanthropy-wealth-billionaires-foundations-donations-2023-6&#34;&gt;world&amp;#39;s wealthiest person&lt;/a&gt; with a net worth of nearly $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett plans on leaving his kids $2 billion each, the Washington Post reported in 2014. He once said in a letter to shareholders that he recommends that super-wealthy families &amp;#34;leave the children enough so that they can do anything but not enough that they can do nothing.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-title&#34;&gt;Even for Buffett, there are things that money can&amp;#39;t buy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-image&#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/55242c7fecad04f863fc8280?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;1050&#34; width=&#34;1400&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;warren buffett&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Bill Pugliano/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;slide-content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;There are things money can&amp;#39;t buy,&amp;#34; Buffett once said at a shareholders&amp;#39; meeting. &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t think standard of living equates with cost of living beyond a certain point.

An added bonus? Getting to see New Year&amp;#39;s Eve fireworks as we flew over LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christmas isn&amp;#39;t the only holiday for cheap flights, either. In 2022, I flew from &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/where-to-eat-palm-springs-california-frequent-visitor-restaurant-recommendations&#34;&gt;Palm Springs&lt;/a&gt; to Puerto Vallarta over Thanksgiving for less than $500 &amp;mdash; about $300 cheaper than non-holiday weeks at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3516ceb3-452f-4b29-b04b-30241038d398&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;3516ceb3-452f-4b29-b04b-30241038d398&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many popular destinations are less crowded during the holidays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.insider.com/674de37fe45a68623a27677e?format=jpeg&#34; height=&#34;1330&#34; width=&#34;1773&#34; charset=&#34;&#34; alt=&#34;A table, chairs, and umbrellas on an empty beach at sunset, as a few people walk along the coast.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Traveling during the holidays can be peaceful.&lt;p class=&#34;copyright&#34;&gt;Marissa Willman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my trip to London, I booked a day trip to Stonehenge for the day after Christmas. However, I failed to realize December 26 is Boxing Day, a major holiday in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This worked out incredibly well, as our tour bus was only half-full, and Stonehenge itself was nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from major shopping destinations like Oxford Street or Harrod&amp;#39;s, London also felt less crowded, and it was easy to get last-minute access to tours and museums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found that it&amp;#39;s not just major cities that see fewer crowds, either. When I spend Christmas at a beachfront &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/margaritaville-cancun-mexico-best-all-inclusive-resort-frequent-traveler-2024-7&#34;&gt;resort in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;s the only time of year I don&amp;#39;t have to wake up early to find a chair by the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;483ae118-c417-4cc6-84ba-390c80e24743&#34; data-toc-id=&#34;483ae118-c417-4cc6-84ba-390c80e24743&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can skip the drama and join family celebrations virtually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest perks of traveling during the holidays is skipping the inevitable family drama. Whether it&amp;#39;s politics, a passive-aggressive slight, or a family grudge that spans generations, holiday get-togethers tend to be a powder keg just waiting for a spark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of therapy and a lot of healing work, I&amp;#39;ve fallen in love with prioritizing my peace &amp;mdash; even if that means skipping a family holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With today&amp;#39;s technology, I can always join the major moments via video call. If things get heated, it&amp;#39;s easy enough to hang up and get right back to vacation mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/skipping-major-holiday-gatherings-to-travel-solo-worth-it&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It has to be a deepfake. There&amp;#39;s no way that&amp;#39;s real,&amp;#39;&amp;#34; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/why-did-south-korea-declare-martial-law-yoon-suk-yeol-2024-12&#34;&gt;shocked the world&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday when he announced he was imposing martial law during a late-night address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decree, which enabled &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-could-seek-to-exploit-south-korean-turmoil-2024-12&#34;&gt;temporary military control&lt;/a&gt; and the suspension of civilian government activities and civil liberties, was the first since the country&amp;#39;s democratization in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon said the declaration was necessary to prevent &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bid-charm-kim-jong-un-will-likely-fall-flat-2024-11&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;subversion by North Korea, South Korea&amp;#39;s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; longtime enemy, but it&amp;#39;s likely he was seeking to quash domestic opposition and bolster his power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He backpedaled six hours later, after the streets were filled with protesters. The decree was voted against by MPs who had to cross barricades and climb walls to make it into the National Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee went viral on social media for &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIJW8oj5hm0&#34;&gt;livestreaming himself&lt;/a&gt; climbing over a fence to the National Assembly building so he could vote against the decree. He described Yoon&amp;#39;s move as unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calls for the president&amp;#39;s resignation are growing. According to the Yonhap news agency, all six opposition parties filed an impeachment motion on Wednesday, with a vote set for Friday or Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoon came to power in 2022, narrowly defeating Lee in the most closely contested presidential election in South Korean history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, his presidency has been riddled with controversy and low approval ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several senior government figures, including the defense minister, have resigned from their posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immediate aftermath, the &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; class=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/south-korea-martial-law-stocks-plunge-coupang-posco-parliament-2024-12&#34;&gt;South Korean won&lt;/a&gt; plunged as much as 3% relative to the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;read-original&#34;&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-opposition-leader-martial-law-declaration-was-deepfake-2024-12&#34;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
