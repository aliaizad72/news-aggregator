<p>According to the Pahang State Executive Councilor for Islamic Affairs, Rural Development, and Orang Asli Affairs, YB. Dato’ Sri Syed Ibrahim Syed Ahmad, the Syariah ordinance is not something new. <strong>It was enacted back in 2013.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Pahang State Government has established a Syariah ordinance in 2013 under Section 53 for those who dress inappropriately in public places,&#8221; Syed Ibrahim said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSOGU7XKPvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">during the 3rd Meeting of the 3rd Term of the Pahang State Legislative Assembly</a> at Wisma Sri Pahang recently.</p></blockquote>

<p>He made this statement while responding to a question from another Member of the State Legislative Assembly (ADUN) for Jengka, YB. Tuan Shahril Azman Abd Halim, regarding the government&#8217;s policy on entertainment involving performances by Muslim women who do not cover their <em>aurat.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>You can be fined or imprisoned</strong></span></p>
<p>The Pahang 2013 Syariah Criminal Offenses Enactment, Section 53: Dressing Inappropriately in Public states that anyone who dresses inappropriately in public <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>can be fined up to RM2,000 or face imprisonment of not more than a year, or both.</strong></span></p>
<p>For instance, The Temerloh Widows&#8217; Costume Competition scheduled for April 21 this year at a karaoke centre near Taman Tasik Chatin, near Mentakab, Pahang has been cancelled. Temerloh Member of Parliament, Salamiah Mohd Nor wanted the event cancelled as it could cause public unease and spread immoral elements, as said by Salamiah in her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CikguSalamiah/posts/pfbid09puM2Shd6J6ssRjrrXAveL9iou7D5k4Tti1zJSsiUu3hDyL2aNfBphYWjkVuPT3el?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facebook post.</a></p>

<p>Mierul, who also stars in the movie sought answers from netizens.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for asking but is this common? This is my first time seeing this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the reposted screenshot, Mierul also dubbed the inconsiderate action &#8220;dirty and disgusting,&#8221; and reminded everyone to show respect and consideration in shared spaces.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We can look stupid but don&#8217;t be stupid. It&#8217;s not that hard to show some respect. Don&#8217;t assume everywhere is home.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Social media users also expressed disgust at the behaviours of the said cinemagoers and said it was inconsiderate.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;This is rude and inconsiderate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we tell them off, it&#8217;s going to get heated. People like this are usually stupid and egotistical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With CCTV cameras in the hall, they should&#8217;ve been fined RM100 each.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another user said this is something that should not be normalized, saying, <strong>&#8220;It pisses me off to see people behaving like this.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;If you see others behaving the same way, feel free to inform the cinema ushers. They have the right to remove anyone who disrespects others in the cinema.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should make it common to tell off anyone who behaves like this.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>To those who frequent the cinemas, what would you do if you spotted such behaviour? Would you tell them off if they happen to rest their feet on top, or next to your seat?</em></p>

Unfortunately, the bright girl didn&#8217;t make it.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.chinapress.com.my/?p=4212642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">China Press</a>, the girl was rushed to a hospital where she spent 2 days in a comatose state before passing away this morning (December 5). The student, a 17-year-old girl from Batu Pahat, Johor, is said to be her family&#8217;s only daughter and a straight-A student.</p>
<div id="attachment_703902" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-703902" class="wp-image-703902" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coma-3.jpeg" alt="coma 3" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coma-3.jpeg 700w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coma-3-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coma-3-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/coma-3-250x141.jpeg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-703902" class="wp-caption-text">This image is for illustration purposes only.</p></div>
<p>Johor State Health and Environment Committee Chairman and State Assemblyman, Ling Tian Soon, confirmed the incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>She complained of a headache and fainted</strong></span></p>
<p>He shared that the girl had complained to her family about a headache while at home 2 days ago. She soon fainted and was sent to a clinic for first aid. She was then rushed to a hospital for further treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor said that the female student suffered from blood stasis due to a burst blood vessel in her brain, causing her to go into a coma. The female student was in a coma when she was admitted to the hospital. Her teachers and classmates went to visit her in the past 2 days,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But unexpectedly, the situation took a turn for the worst. She could not withstand the call of death and sadly passed away at about 9:40am, this morning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703898" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/student-1.jpg" alt="student 1" width="600" height="449" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/student-1.jpg 598w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/student-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/student-1-150x112.jpg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/student-1-250x187.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Ling went on to share how the student&#8217;s parents had praised her for being diligent and hard-working and had been focused on preparing for her SPM examinations to obtain good results.</p>
<p>Her parents took good care of her and accompanied her while she was in a comatose state in the hospital.</p>
<p>Our sincerest condolences to the student&#8217;s family, friends and loved ones.</p>

<p>Today, another group is saying otherwise.</p>
<p>Malaysian hacker group, <a href="https://x.com/dragonforceIO_/status/1864203250540704202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">DragonForce Malaysia</a>, took to their X page to claim that StealthMole&#8217;s accusations are untrue, as the ICs showcased apparently have false and weird names such as &#8216;Devil Bin Satan&#8217;.</p>

<p>They wrote, &#8220;You&#8217;re not sure? Don&#8217;t share it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re angry with media practitioners and influencers for playing tricks with invalid information. Does &#8216;Sultan Sulu&#8217; have an IC? If it&#8217;s easy to get attention like this, we can post 2 to 3 photos of zionists&#8217; passports and claim that 50 million zionists&#8217; passports have been leaked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Stealth Mole&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/stealthmole_int/status/1863781770111668639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">post</a>, they shared how the people responsible for selling Malaysians&#8217; IC data had posted a photo showing several sample ICs that have been censored.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703569" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IC-5.jpg" alt="IC 5" width="502" height="631" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IC-5.jpg 445w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IC-5-239x300.jpg 239w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IC-5-119x150.jpg 119w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IC-5-199x250.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></p>
<p>DragonForce Malaysia shared the same picture uncensored, with the IC holder&#8217;s names shown as &#8216;Devil Bin Satan&#8217;, &#8216;Dato Hussin&#8217; and more, to prove that the ICs are supposedly fake.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Devil Bin Satan&#8217;s IC states that his birthday is October 2, 2000, making him 24 years old. However, his IC picture clearly shows an elderly man well beyond his 20s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-703887" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ID-7-1.jpg" alt="ID 7 1" width="501" height="677" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ID-7-1.jpg 411w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ID-7-1-222x300.jpg 222w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ID-7-1-111x150.jpg 111w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ID-7-1-185x250.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we hope authorities will investigate this matter and offer more clarity on the issue.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703842" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125659.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2024 12 05 125659" width="400" height="309" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125659.jpg 285w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125659-150x116.jpg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125659-250x193.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>While she was being served, the staff politely asked her who the cake was for, to which the auntie replied that <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it was, in fact, her own birthday</span></strong> that very day.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One day, an auntie came in to buy a cake. As usual, our staff asked who the cake was for. The auntie told us it was her birthday.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703843" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125741.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2024 12 05 125741" width="400" height="302" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125741.jpg 287w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125741-150x113.jpg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125741-250x189.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">The auntie blew out the candle on her cake by herself</span></strong></p>
<p>When the staff found out it was the auntie&#8217;s birthday, she decided to let the auntie know that <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the cake would be on the house</span></strong> and she wouldn&#8217;t be charged.</p>
<p>Despite the kind gesture, <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the auntie insisted on paying</span></strong> for the cake, but the staff graciously refused to accept the payment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A few minutes later, we noticed the auntie celebrating her birthday alone, even blowing out the candle on her cake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The auntie left the bakery to visit a nearby shop, but as soon as she stepped out, the staff at the bakery came up with a plan to surprise her with a <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">mini celebration</span></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">&#8220;She reminded us why we do what we do&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p>When the auntie returned to the bakery, <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">she had bought biscuits</span></strong> to give to the staff as a thank-you for their kindness in not charging her for the cake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703847" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125947.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2024 12 05 125947" width="400" height="304" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125947.jpg 284w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125947-150x114.jpg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-125947-250x190.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>However, what she didn&#8217;t expect was the surprise waiting for her. As she walked back in, the staff gathered together and <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">started singing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; </span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to her</span></span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While we were singing to the auntie, we couldn&#8217;t help but get teary-eyed. Some of the staff even started to cry. The auntie’s tears of joy reminded us all of why we do what we do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Business has its ups and downs, and there have been countless moments when I felt like giving up. But moments like this- witnessing her tears of joy as we sang for her, remind us why we do what we do. This is the reason we keep going. It’s what drives us, and it always will.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;One was a wedding planner, and another one packed the goody bags. They handled the wedding outfits and the decorations too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>All of his wives&#8217; families as well as the team members from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/poligamiharmonimalaysia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Malaysian Harmony Polygamy Organisation</a> also attended the wedding. Amirul also said he initially hesitated to have a wedding ceremony due to the availability of the wedding halls, but he continued with the ceremony, nonetheless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>&#8220;Polygamy isn&#8217;t something new but people still have trouble accepting this&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>Amirul also shared his take on polygamy, saying that society is still not accepting of polygamy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No doubt, there have been cases of domestic violence but we have to admit, the society is still having a hard time to understand polygamy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The man also said he started his polygamy life in 2021, making this his 4th year practising polygamy. Throughout the years, he has met people in the same circle who practice similar polygamy marriages and suggested Malaysian men who want to do the same to mingle in the same circle.</p>

<p>The influencer, Isa Isarb, took to his <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isarbians/video/7443301008094039304?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7186957470950065666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TikTok page</a> to showcase the incident, in which the police officer who stopped him and his friends told them to stop their antics.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703767" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-1.jpg" alt="pool 1" width="400" height="444" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-1.jpg 310w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-1-270x300.jpg 270w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-1-135x150.jpg 135w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-1-225x250.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>He wrote, &#8220;Isa Isarb got stopped by the police!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video showcased, Isa Isarb and his friends could be seen in the swimming pool of the converted Proton Waja, while it was being towed by a BMW on a highway.</p>
<p>The Proton Waja&#8217;s roof had been cut off and the entire backseat had been converted into a swimming pool, completely filled with water.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703766" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-2.jpg" alt="pool 2" width="399" height="448" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-2.jpg 310w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-2-267x300.jpg 267w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-2-134x150.jpg 134w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-2-223x250.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>Suddenly, a police car showed up behind them and flashed their lights, signalling for the group to stop.</p>
<p>When they did stop, the police officer in the police car confronted them via his loudspeaker, asking them what the group thought they were doing and scolding them to get out of their converted vehicle, before approaching the group.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What are you guys doing? How can you (ride you makeshift vehicle) here? Call a tow truck now! Get down!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While speaking to the police officer, Isa Isarb explained that he and his friends converted a Proton Waja into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>The police told them that their actions were dangerous, especially if they caused an accident, and asked them where they were going, to which Isa Isard responded, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>&#8220;To Terengganu&#8221;, from Klang.</strong></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703765" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-3.jpg" alt="pool 3" width="399" height="445" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-3.jpg 310w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-3-269x300.jpg 269w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-3-134x150.jpg 134w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-3-224x250.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-703764" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-4.jpg" alt="pool 4" width="399" height="449" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-4.jpg 309w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-4-266x300.jpg 266w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-4-133x150.jpg 133w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-4-222x250.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>The group also clarified that, while the BMW towing them had a road tax, they only had a grant to the Proton Waja.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as it doesn&#8217;t cause an accident,&#8221; the police officer said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Netizens want action to be taken</strong></span></p>
<p>The video then showed the police officer driving away, leaving them at the side of the highway. It is unknown whether the police officer took action against the group or if he had just let them off with a warning.</p>
<p>This caused many to call out the police for allegedly not taking action against the influencers for their dangerous antics.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t get fined? (The vehicle) was not seized? Give me that police car&#8217;s number plate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they get fined? Aren&#8217;t they in the wrong?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-703769" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-9.jpg" alt="pool 9" width="535" height="103" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-9.jpg 535w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-9-300x58.jpg 300w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-9-150x29.jpg 150w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-9-250x48.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Summon them lah. What&#8217;s wrong is wrong. How can they just be let go like that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Even motorcycles without brake lights would get seized. This one, with the roof cut off, they can just be told to call a tow truck.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 16pt;">If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try again?</span></h4>
<p>In another video, it is revealed that the group didn&#8217;t proceed with their journey as the Proton Waja had been damaged and called for a tow truck to transport the Proton Waja elsewhere.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-703763" src="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-5.jpg" alt="pool 5" width="400" height="448" srcset="https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-5.jpg 309w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-5-268x300.jpg 268w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-5-134x150.jpg 134w, https://worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pool-5-223x250.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>

<p>Isa Isarb then suggested his group buy another car in Terengganu and convert it into a swimming pool. While Isa Isarb said they should discard the Proton Waja somewhere, one of his friends said that they should give it away to one of their fans.</p>
