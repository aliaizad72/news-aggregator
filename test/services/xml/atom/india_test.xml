After capturing Aleppo, rebels of  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) are moving forward to Hama. After Hama, the rebels will move towards the city of Tartus where the Russian forces have made a Naval base. Now, Russian forces have started launching missiles on HTS rebels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syrian forces have also targeted rebels to push them back. Turkey-backed rebels can capture Khmeimim Air Base anytime soon. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had given this airbase to Russian forces in 2015. After the development, the Syrian President got an edge in the civil war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hama is Syria&#8217;s fourth-largest city. On December 4, Russian forces launched a massive offensive against the rebels, pushing them back by 10 kilometers. For the safety of Syria&#8217;s capital, Damascus, Assad&#8217;s forces must not allow Hama to fall into the hands of the rebels. Hama is also considered as the gateway of coastal cities Tartus and Latakia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides HTS, the Turkey-backed militia, Syrian National Army, is also involved in the war. Meanwhile, the UN&#8217;s Special Envoy for Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, stated that thousands of civilians have fled the region due to the conflict. Amid rising tensions, Russia has removed its five warships and one submarine. On December 2, the Russian auxiliary ship Yelnya departed from Tartus. Now, President Assad appears to be on the backfoot, with rebels setting their sights on Damascus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts believe that Russia won&#8217;t be able to help Assad if it is removing its warships and submarines. This clearly indicates that the situation in Syria could worsen at any time, they added.</span></p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.india.com/viral/weeks-after-ratan-tatas-death-his-manager-shantanu-naidus-latest-post-goes-viral-it-is-related-to-7444511/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ratan Tata news: </strong>Millennial Shantanu Naidu, the trusted manager of the late industrialist Ratan Tata, was recently in headlines billionaire Ratan Tata left us. Following the passing of the former Tata Group chairman, Naidu recently shared an update on LinkedIn. Shantanu Naidu developed an extraordinary bond with the late Ratan Tata, a relationship that went far beyond the usual mentor-protege dynamic</p>
<p>In his recent post, Naidu announced the launch of a new passion project—the Jaipur edition of &#8220;Bookies,&#8221; a reading community initiative aimed at rekindling the love for books.</p>
<p>Initially introduced in Mumbai, the initiative later expanded to Pune and Bengaluru before reaching Jaipur. Naidu plans to extend Bookies to other Indian cities, including Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Surat.</p>
<h2>Shantanu Naidu&#8217;s post for late Ratan Tata</h2>
<p>After Ratan Tata died in October this year, Naidu wrote an emotional tribute that expressed his deep sense of loss. Ratan Tata&#8217;s legacy also included a surprising element, Naidu. The Will revealed that Tata had relinquished his part in Naidu&#8217;s business venture, Goodfellows. Furthermore, it was reported that Tata even went a step further and absolved Naidu&#8217;s educational loans.</p>
<p>“The hole that this friendship has now left with me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to fill. Grief is the price we pay for love. Goodbye, my dear lighthouse..” Shantanu said on the demise of Ratan Tata.</p>
<h2>About Shantanu Naidu</h2>
<p>Despite the significant age gap, their connection blended the perspectives of a millennial and a boomer. Naidu and Tata first met in 2014 when Naidu began working for the Tata Group. Their mutual love for dogs helped foster a close bond between the two, leading to a deep friendship over the years. As a fifth-generation Tata employee, Shantanu initially set out on a mission to design glow-in-the-dark collars for stray dogs to protect them from traffic accidents.</p>
<p>Talking about the will of late Ratan Tata, Shantanu Naidu, will inherit a portion of Tata’s estate—a testament to their deep bond and Naidu’s devotion to ‘The Goodfellows’ initiative. Moreover, the inclusion of Shantanu Naidu in Tata’s will reveals a bond unlike any conventional ties.</p>

Prior to this, no woman from the Kapoor family had actively pursued a career in acting. Even actresses who married into the Kapoor family, such as Neetu Kapoor and Babita Kapoor, had distanced themselves from the film industry. Karisma made her grand entrance with Prem Qaidi, alongside a child actor who was making his mark in Bollywood. While Karisma’s career soared to new heights after the success of Prem Qaidi, this child artist despite starring in several hit films, faded from the industry after a tragic accident. Let&#8217;s explore where Harish Kumar is now and what led to his career&#8217;s downfall.</p>
<h2>Meet Karisma Kapoor&#8217;s first hero</h2>
<p>Harish Kumar&#8217;s journey in the film industry began at just 13 years old when he appeared as a child artist in the 1983 film Andhra Kesari. His impressive performance earned him the Nandi Award for Best Child Artist, a prestigious honor presented by the then-Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, N.T. Rama Rao, himself a former actor and filmmaker. This early recognition helped Harish establish a promising future in acting.</p>
<p>Harish Kumar made his debut as a lead actor in the Malayalam film Daisy before making his Bollywood debut with Prem Qaidi in 1991, opposite Karishma Kapoor. The film was a box office success, and Harish quickly gained recognition for his performance. He then went on to star in several successful films, including Tiranga and Coolie No. 1. His career was on an upward trajectory, with many fans and critics taking notice of his talent.</p>
<h2>Tragic Injury and Career Setback</h2>
<p>However, Harish&#8217;s promising career came to a halt after a severe back injury in 2001. He sustained a slip disc, which left him in constant pain and made even simple tasks, like walking to the bathroom, extremely difficult. His L3 and L5 vertebrae were damaged, leaving him unable to continue working in films. Doctors advised complete bed rest, and Harish slowly withdrew from the limelight. His absence became so prolonged that it was unclear for years what had happened to him.</p>
<h2>A New Journey Behind the Camera</h2>
<p>Despite stepping away from acting, Harish Kumar didn’t sever his ties with the film industry. He transitioned into the world of filmmaking, focusing on writing scripts, dialogues, and screenplays for various projects. Although he’s no longer in front of the camera, his passion for cinema remains intact. Harish may have left the spotlight, but he continues to contribute to the industry in his own way, proving that his love for movies never truly faded.</p>

The Taliban has announced the closure of training camps where nurses and doctors are trained, both the legendary cricketers have reportedly strongly criticized the closure of institutes related to women&#8217;s training. The restrictions are a fresh setback to women’s rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August 2021, the Taliban have banned secondary and higher education for girls and women, with the exception of the medical field.</p>
<p>Girls and women were also banned from participating in the sport, after which the Afghanistan team came under the radar as a full member of the ICC last year. Rashid wrote in the Instagram story that education has a central place in Islam, which emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge for both men and women.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>He further wrote that the Quran highlights the importance of learning and acknowledges the equal spiritual worth of men and women. In his post, Rashid expressed his views on the closure of educational and medical institutes. At the same time, he described the acute shortage of nurses in the country as a matter of concern.</p>
<p>Whereas Mohammad Nabi wrote on X (formerly Twitter) &#8211; the Taliban&#8217;s decision to ban girls from studying medicine is not only heartbreaking but also extremely unjust. Nabi wrote &#8211; Islam has always emphasized the importance of education for all, and history is replete with inspiring examples of Muslim women who have made significant contributions to many generations through knowledge.</p>

Nabi further wrote in his post &#8211; I urge the Taliban to consider these values. Not giving girls a chance to learn and serve their people is a betrayal of both their dreams and the future of our country. Meanwhile, Rahmanullah Gurbaz also expressed his support for women&#8217;s education by posting a post on Facebook. Remember, Mohammad Nabi remained unsold in this IPL. Rashid Khan is in Gujarat Titans while Gurbaz is in KKR.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.india.com/business/bad-news-for-noel-tata-as-ratan-tata-tata-motors-may-miss-key-ev-target-again-due-to-low-sales-7444398/"><![CDATA[<p>In a major setback for Tata Trusts Chairman, Noel Tata, Tata Motors is poised to miss its intended target of selling 100,000 units of EVs for the second year in a row. According to a report by the Economic Times, Tata Motors, the largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer in India, is likely to record lower EV sales this fiscal compared to last year.</p>
<p>As per the ET report, Tata Motors has witnessed a 11.2% year-on- year decline in wholesales or dispatches to dealers in the first eight months of this fiscal year through March, dispatching only 42,778 units, which is significantly lower than its 73,844 EV sales in last financial year. Notably, the automaker had witnessed a remarkable 48% jump in sales in FY24, but the current numbers suggest that the company is well on its way to experience its first sales decline since it ventured into the EV market in FY21.</p>
<h2>Market slowdown, de-incentivisation key reasons for low sales</h2>
<p>According to market analysts, various factors, such as the broader slowdown witnessed in the domestic car market, in addition to withdrawal of EV incentives by some states as well as the central government, are some of the reasons for Tata Motors&#8217; drop in EV sales, despite the company introducing a couple of new models in the market.</p>
<p>Tata Group Chairman, N Chandrasekaran, who also heads Tata Motors, had set a goal for the company to double its EV sales in this fiscal, but currently it looks like that the carmaker will miss that target of 100,000 unit sales for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>A Tata Motors spokesperson blamed the slump on the slowdown in EV adoption in the country, and the withdrawal of incentives by the state and central governments. &#8220;In FY25, the entire passenger car industry is witnessing flattish growth and the slowdown in the EV adoption curve can be corelated to this. Further, discontinuity in central and state policies incentivising EV purchase have also contributed to this slowdown,&#8221; the report quoted the spokesperson as saying.</p>
<h2>Tata Motors records modest growth in Nov</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, on Sunday, Tata Motors  reported a marginal increase in overall sales at 74,753 units in November as compared to 74,172 units in the same month last year. In a statement, Tata Motors said its total domestic sales were up 1 per cent at 73,246 units last month as against 72,647 units in November 2023.</p>
<p>Total passenger vehicle (PV) sales, including EVs, were at 47,117 units as compared to 46,143 units in the year-ago month, up 2 per cent, it added.</p>
<h2>Setback for Noel Tata</h2>
<p>The drop in Tata Motors&#8217; EV sales comes as a major setback for the Tata Group, nearly two months after the conglomerate lost its Chairman Emeritus, Ratan Tata, who died due to age-related issues at Mumbai&#8217;s Breach Candy Hospital on October 9. He was 86.</p>
<p>Following Ratan Tata&#8217;s demise, his half-brother Noel Tata, was picked as the new chairman of Tata Trusts, an umbrella group of charities which holds 66% stake in Tata Sons &#8212; the holding company of Tata Group.</p>
<p>After Ratan Tata&#8217;s death, Noel Tata, 67, was picked by the board to lead Tata Trusts, which essentially owns Tata Sons, having a 66 percent stake in the holding company which runs the Tata Group, essentially making Noel, the single most powerful person in the Rs 34 lakh crore Tata business empire.</p>
<p>The Tata Group, established by its founder Jamshedji Nasirwanji Tata in 1868 when he bought a bankrupt oil mill for Rs 21,000, a massive amount at the time, and turned it into a cotton factory, has today grown into a global juggernaut with over 100 companies spread in more than 100 countries, boasting a market cap of $403 billion (roughly Rs 33.7 trillion).</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.india.com/news/world/scared-pakistan-plans-to-boost-its-air-force-by-using-chinese-made-fifth-generation-fighter-aircraft-can-indias-rafael-outperform-it-7444368/"><![CDATA[<p>In a potential bad news for India, Pakistan has reportedly approved the purchase of a new Chinese-made fifth-generation fighter jet. The Chinese-made fifth-generation fighter jet named as Shenyang J-35 is a series of Chinese twin-engine, all-weather, stealth multirole combat aircraft. Manufactured by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC), the aircraft is designed for air superiority and surface strike missions.</p>
<p>The defence acquisition is part of Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) plan to enhance its air attack capabilities. Moreover, as a cause of concern for India, the Shenyang J-35 is expected to outperform India’s advanced fighters, such as the Rafale and Sukhoi Su-30MKI. The advantage of the own fifth-generation fighter jets is expected to remain with Pakistan until India secures its own.</p>
<p>The J-35, a masterpiece of Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, is designed to tackle both air and ground combat. Early signs of its importation into Pakistan&#8217;s fleet are apparent as Pakistani Air Force pilots are right now in China honing their skills in manoeuvring this advanced aircraft. This is a major move by Pakistan, as it is in line with its grand scheme to breathe new life into its air force, replacing the somewhat dated F-16s and Mirage 5s with cutting-edge fighter jets.</p>
<h2>About J-<span class="highlight" data-qa-component="highlight-text">35A </span>stealth fighter jet</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s new J-<span class="highlight" data-qa-component="highlight-text">35A </span>stealth fighter jet debuted in November at the country&#8217;s biggest civil and military air show during a flying display, Chinese state television CCTV reported. The J-<span class="highlight" data-qa-component="highlight-text">35A</span>, which uses airstrips to take off and land, is a variant of the J-35, a stealthy aircraft China is developing for use on aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The J-<span class="highlight" data-qa-component="highlight-text">35A </span>was designed and built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China. Little is known about its performance or capabilities, although it superficially resembles the Lockheed Martin LMT.N F-35.</p>
<p>The state-controlled People&#8217;s Daily news outlet said ahead of the air show the J-<span class="highlight" data-qa-component="highlight-text">35A </span>&#8220;mainly carries out the task of seizing and maintaining air supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The six-day China International Aviation &amp; Aerospace Exhibition, a biennial event where Beijing showcases its expanding aerospace industry, takes place in Zhuhai from Nov. 12-17.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.india.com/entertainment/meet-bollywoods-richest-female-singer-tulsi-kumar-has-a-net-worth-of-rs-210-crore-not-shreya-ghoshal-sunidhi-chauhan-neha-kakkar-alka-yagnik-or-asha-bhosle-7444193/"><![CDATA[<p>Hindi pop music has always been an important part of Indian cinema, with artists making a lasting impact on the industry. Indian singers have contributed greatly to the success of films, with their songs becoming iconic. Over the years, many top singers have gained fame, and it’s no surprise that some of them have built impressive wealth. Currently, the richest female singer in India has a net worth of over 200 crores. Interestingly, despite her wealth, she isn’t among the most popular singers in the country. Let’s explore who she is and how she achieved such success. Read on to find more details.</p>
<h2>Meet the Richest Singer in India</h2>
<p><strong>Tulsi Kumar</strong>, the daughter of T-Series owner Gulshan Kumar, is India’s richest female singer. According to India Times, her total net worth is estimated at around 210 crores, placing her ahead of not only every other female singer in India but also several well-known Bollywood stars. Tulsi&#8217;s wealth comes from her stake in the family business, which is valued in the thousands of crores. T-Series, which has been a giant in the Indian music and film production industry, has played a crucial role in Tulsi&#8217;s success. Additionally, Tulsi owns the Kids Hut channel on YouTube, which focuses on children&#8217;s content, including nursery rhymes, educational songs, and stories. This channel has added to her overall wealth and expanded her influence beyond just music.</p>
<h2>Tulsi Kumar’s Music Career</h2>
<p>Despite not being at the top of the charts for most of her career, Tulsi Kumar has managed to carve out a successful singing career over the past two decades. She has sung hit songs in several popular Bollywood films, including Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Ready, Dabangg, Kabir Singh, and Satyaprem Ki Katha. She initially rose to fame in the early 2000s by collaborating with music director Himesh Reshammiya, lending her voice to some of the most loved tracks like Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, Aksar, and Afsana. Her versatility as a playback singer has made her a well-recognized voice in the Bollywood music scene.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.india.com/news/world/bad-news-for-iran-as-us-makes-big-move-to-make-tehran-beg-for-money-will-also-destroy-2-indian-companies-dealing-in-iran-oil-shipping-iran-israel-war-netanyahu-joe-biden-khamenei-donald-trump-7444286/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Iran sanctions</strong>: In more trouble for Iran, which is embroiled in a raging conflict with Israel on multiple fronts in the Middle East, the United States has imposed sanction on as many as 35 companies and ships, including two Indian firms, that transport Iran&#8217;s oil to other countries. The move has the potential to bankrupt Iran by putting more strain on its already fragile economy which has borne the brunt of sanctions by US and its allies for decades.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the US Department of the Treasury announced that it was imposing sanctions of 35 companies and ships, which include two Indian firms &#8212; Vision Ship Management LLP,  that manages and operates the PHONIX, and Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Department of Treasury said this action imposes additional costs on Iran’s petroleum sector following Iran’s attack against Israel on October 1, as well as Tehran’s announced nuclear escalations, building upon the sanctions issued on October 11.</p>
<p>Petroleum revenues provide the Iranian regime with the resources to fund its nuclear program, develop advanced drones and missiles, and provide ongoing financial and material support for the terrorist activities of its regional proxies, it said.</p>
<p>“Iran continues to funnel revenues from its petroleum trade toward the development of its nuclear program, proliferation of its ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle technology, and sponsorship of its regional terrorist proxies, risking further destabilizing the region,&#8221; said Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley T Smith.</p>
<p>Smith said the US remains committed to &#8220;disrupting the shadow fleet of vessels and operators that facilitate these illicit activities, using the full range of our tools and authorities&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Sanctions slapped on Indian firms</h2>
<p>According to the Treasury, India-based Vision Ship Management LLP manages and operates the PHONIX, formerly known as the LUNA LAKE, which has carried millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil for CCPC since 2022.</p>
<p>The company also owns, manages, and operates the Cook Islands-flagged RIO NAPO (IMO: 9256913) and the Panama-flagged LARA II (IMO: 9321421). The RIO NAPO previously transported 35,000 metric tons of Iranian naphtha worth approximately $21.5 million to the UAE, it said.</p>
<p>India-based Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited manages or operates the OLIVE, BLACK PANTHER, and LIONESS, which have collectively carried tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil for NIOC since at least 2022.</p>
<p>The BLACK PANTHER has engaged in ship-to-ship transfers of Iranian oil with Iranian-flagged vessels.</p>
<p>Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited is involved in the management of a fourth vessel, the Panama-flagged TONIL (IMO: 9307932), which is managed and operated by Ukraine-based Lightship Management Ltd and has skirted sanctions to carry millions of barrels of oil for Iran, the Treasury alleged.</p>
<p>Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited and Lightship Management Ltd are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13902 for operating in the petroleum sector of the Iranian economy.</p>
<p>The OLIVE, the BLACK PANTHER, and the LIONESS are being identified as property in which Tightship Shipping Management (OPC) Private Limited has an interest.</p>
<p>The TONIL is being identified as property in which Lightship Management Ltd has an interest.</p>

On 5 December, Shah visited the ICC headquarters in Dubai for the first time as ICC President where he had a special meeting with the directors and staff of the ICC Board.</p>
<p>Shah said after his visit, &#8216;This tour provided me with an invaluable opportunity to connect with my colleagues on the ICC Board, where we discussed the initial roadmap and strategies to shape the future of this incredible game. I was also delighted to meet the dedicated ICC team who work tirelessly to take cricket forward.&#8217;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Shah described his visit as useful and inspiring and acknowledged the long road ahead. He said, &#8216;I am excited by what I saw, but I believe that this is just the beginning. The hard work to take cricket to unprecedented heights has now begun and I am confident that together we will achieve this goal.&#8217;</p>
<p>At the same time, ICC Vice President Imran Khwaja also praised Shah&#8217;s ambitious vision for the game. Khwaja said, &#8216;On behalf of the board, I would like to welcome Mr. Jay Shah to this position and share my enthusiasm for his tenure. Mr Shah&#8217;s ambition and experience will help guide the ICC and the game in the future. It has been a very useful tour for everyone. We look forward to working closely with him, the members and the ICC team to achieve success.&#8217;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that today an important meeting of the ICC is to be held regarding the controversy of the Champions Trophy, which is going to be chaired by Jay Shah. It is expected that after this meeting, there will be an official announcement regarding organizing the Champions Trophy under the hybrid model. After being adamant for a long time, the PCB has had to bow down to the ICC. Dubai can be chosen as a neutral venue.</p>
