<p>PETALING JAYA: No alternative plan has been announced since the Armed Forces Fund Board (LTAT) Strategic Plan 2023-2025 was halted 10 months ago, says the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
<p>During a briefing session on the PACs report on LTAT at the Dewan Rakyat sitting today, PAC member Dr Halimah Ali said this delay exposes LTAT to the continuance of its impairment which has been going on for the last five years.</p>
<p>Exposure to the risk of dependence on Boustead Holdings Bhd (which is wholly owned by LTAT) without a comprehensive restructuring programme hinders LTATs transformation into a sustainable retirement fund and its ability to generate competitive dividends consistently, Bernama reported her as saying.</p>
<p>She said the PAC also found that several asset sale transactions were carried out but not publicly announced by Boustead.</p>
<p>Halimah said that in the latest development, Eco World Development Group Bhd announced the purchase of land owned by Boustead subsidiary Mutiara Balau Sdn Bhd worth RM742 million, which is set to generate development value of up to RM4.6 billion for Eco World.</p>
<p>The Edge reported her as saying the PAC was informed that LTAT plans to sell farmland owned by Boustead Plantations Bhd in Batu Kawan, Penang, to Ideal Properties Bhd.</p>
<p>Under the halted Boustead restructuring plan, both these parcels of farmland had been recommended to remain under Boustead Properties Bhd, which is wholly owned by LTAT, for development purposes.</p>
<p>Is the selling of these land and assets Bousteads new restructuring approach to generate cash flow and reduce its debts? she said.</p>
<p>Halimah, who is the Kapar MP, said this approach is short term, will affect the value of LTATs assets and will not solve LTATs problems in the long term.</p>
<p>What is of more concern (is that) this asset sale strategy was done discreetly without public knowledge. This differs from the restructuring plan under the LTAT Strategic Plan 2023-2025, which was publicly announced and discussed.</p>
<p>As such, the PAC hopes the defence ministry and LTAT will be ready with the appropriate responses in follow-up proceedings next year to the concerns raised, besides the suggestions made by the committee, she said.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Local rapper Sharifah Zamaera Al Edros Syed Zafilen has accused a Subang Jaya City Council (MBSJ) officer of secretly recording her while she was undressed during a massage session in SS14.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on X, the rapper known as Zamaera detailed her ordeal, accusing the officer of entering the establishment and recording a video of her while she was covered only in a towel.</p>
<p>Zamaera said she was in room seven at the Chiang Thai massage parlour when several Malay-speaking men, purportedly MBSJ enforcement officers, entered the premises.</p>
<p>They were making so much noise, she said, adding that she initially tried to ignore them to enjoy her massage.</p>
<p>However, Zamaera claimed one officer filmed her while she was exposed during the session. When confronted, the officer allegedly justified the recording by saying it was part of MBSJs standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>Which part of invading the privacy of a customer by recording them naked is ethical in any way? she questioned.</p>
<p>Zamaera said the officer later denied the incident, claiming no video evidence existed even though she saw him record her.</p>
<p>She criticised the officers for failing to announce their presence at the establishment, accusing them of behaving unprofessionally.</p>
<p>If youre entering a massage parlour, you need to make an announcement. Instead, you sneak in and violate someones privacy.</p>
<p>The rapper called out the authorities, demanding accountability for the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>It is understood that she has lodged a police report regarding the incident.</p>
<p>FMT has reached out to MBSJ and the police for comments on the matter.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: A political scientist says Umnos struggle to regain its political strength of yesteryear may require it to embrace local elections.</p>
<p>Calling it a radical paradigm shift, Wong Chin Huat of Sunway University said this is the first step Malaysia must take to depart from its majoritarian political structure.</p>
<p>Wong said the winner-take-all majoritarian system had previously benefitted Umno up until 2018, but is now cruelly penalising the party, sandwiched between its arch-rival PAS and its senior partner Pakatan Harapan.</p>

<p>Previously, Umno and Barisan Nasional could monopolise local council seats in the absence of elections. Thats why it suspended local elections in 1965 and later abolished them entirely in 1976, he told FMT.</p>
<p>Whenever a coalition wins a state, it takes all local council seats. Before 2008, it was BN-Umno in most peninsular states.</p>
<p>All local councillor posts became patronage posts for party leaders to dispense. However, this weakened BNs competitiveness, because their councillors did not have to be popular to be appointed.</p>
<p>Wongs comments follow federal territories Barisan Nasional chief Johari Ghanis statement that the Umno-led coalition must be cured of four sicknesses if it is to return to political dominance.</p>
<p>Among the ills listed by Johari was that of inertia, which he said had resulted in BN being comfortable with existing practices and unable to carry out reforms in the coalition.</p>
<p>Wong said that without local elections, all 31 local authorities in Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis have become training grounds for PN junior politicians.</p>
<p>He said this is one reason why PAS has become so entrenched in the four states.</p>
<p>Even in Selangor (12 councils) and Penang (two councils) run by its ally PH, Umno has found itself in a downward spiral.</p>
<p>PH wont give Umno many councillor seats because of the partys poor electoral support, but without such councillor seats, Umno can never regain its foothold in these two states.</p>
<p>Can Umno expect to make a comeback if it gets wiped out in Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis, and is constantly marginalised in the two prosperous PH-run states? he said.</p>
<p>Wong said Umnos comeback against Perikatan Nasionals hegemony among the Malays depends on it being able to challenge PAS in the north and compete with PH in friendly matches in the rest of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Umnos rejuvenation requires Malaysia to depart from majoritarianism. Umno needs to push the Madani government towards introducing local elections first in PH states, which PH supporters would wholeheartedly support.</p>
<p>The other reforms Umno should push include decentralisation, senatorial elections and a mixed-member system with party-list proportional representation seats alongside existing first-past-the-post seats, he said.</p>

<p>In a separate High Court, his wife, Suhaini Sarwan, 46, pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing articles and items related to the Daesh group on her mobile phone and laptop before Justice Jamil Hussin.</p>

<p>GEORGE TOWN: US ambassador to Malaysia Edgard D Kagan has urged critics not to underestimate Americas economic influence amid discussions about Chinas growing economic might.</p>
<p>In his keynote speech at an event by the Penang Institute, Kagan said the US remains a global economic powerhouse and a strong partner to Malaysia.</p>
<p>Dont write us off, he said, pointing out that the US has contributed 43% of global economic growth since 2021, while China has contributed only 4%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The IMF expects the world economy to grow 3.2% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025, driven by the resilience of the US and large emerging markets, as well as fiscal support from China.</p>
<p>Kagan said the US and Malaysia share a long-standing and growing partnership, especially in trade and investment.</p>
<p>He noted that US companies have committed over RM200 billion in new investments to Malaysia since 2021, including from tech giants such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>When US companies announce investments, by and large they follow through, he said, comparing the reliability of American investors to others.</p>
<p>Kagan also said the US became Malaysias second-largest export market in 2024, surpassing China.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade increased by 29% this year, fuelled by high-value exports such as semiconductors and advanced electronics, he said.</p>
<p>US exports to Malaysia enhance the countrys ability to produce sophisticated goods, moving it up the value chain and creating prosperity for both nations, he said.</p>
<p>Kagan said American companies have also significantly contributed to Malaysias workforce, with most jobs in the US manufacturing facilities in Malaysia held by locals.</p>
<p>Many of these employees rise to leadership positions locally and globally, he added.</p>
<p>Regarding concerns over Donald Trumps upcoming presidency, Kagan reiterated that the exact policies of the incoming administration would not be clear until the inauguration on Jan 20.</p>
<p>However, he assured that the US-Malaysia relationship would remain stable.</p>

<p>TAWAU: A student testified in the High Court here today he overheard Nazmie Aizzat Narul Azwan confess that he had stolen money to one of the accused in dormitory room 7 Resak of the Lahad Datu Vocational College.</p>
<p>The 19th prosecution witness, Putra Azdaniel Jhalal Razhiel Jhalal, 19, a diploma student at the college, said he was not sure whose money the victim had stolen.</p>
<p>He initially went to the dormitory to look for coloured pencils for a landscaping assignment at around 10pm on March 21.</p>
<p>When I entered (7 Resak), I saw Ijat (Nazmie) and the fifth accused talking in the middle of the room. The latter accused Ijat of stealing money. Then, Ijat went to his locker and brought out RM50, RM10, RM5 and three RM1 notes, handing them to the fifth accused.</p>
<p>Ijat admitted he stole the money, saying, Yes, I took it.</p>
<p>Then, the first, fourth and fifth accused started hitting the victim, he said during his testimony at the murder trial of Nazmie before Justice Duncan Sikodol.</p>
<p>Thirteen students from the college, aged between 16 and 19, are jointly charged with the murder of the 17-year-old at dormitory rooms 7 Resak and 5 Belian at the Lahad Datu Vocational College, between 9pm on March 21 and 7.38am on March 22.</p>
<p>The charges are framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 of the same code, which provides for the death penalty or imprisonment for 30 to 40 years, and not more than 12 strokes of the cane, if found guilty.</p>
<p>During the examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Nur Nisla Abd Latif, Azdaniel said the three accused had hit the victim more than once, but he could not confirm which parts of the victims body were struck.</p>
<p>He said about an hour later, he went to room 5 Belian, still in search of coloured pencils, and witnessed the 12th accused punching the victim in the abdomen, while the second accused stomped on the victims head, who was lying on the floor at the time.</p>
<p>The witness also mentioned that he helped carry the victim to the Exco Belian bathroom to shower and waited outside.</p>
<p>After five minutes, I helped Ijat into room 7 Belian as I didnt know which room he was from. I felt sorry for him. He had no energy and could barely walk. I then laid him on the bed, he said, adding that the victim thanked him for the gesture.</p>
<p>Besides Nisla, the prosecution is also being handled by deputy public prosecutors Ng Juhn Tao and Batrisyia Khusri.</p>
<p>Eight of the 13 teenagers are represented by lawyers Ram Singh, Kamarudin Chinki, and Chen Wen Jye; while five others are represented by lawyers Zairi Zainal Abidin, Abdul Ghani Zelika, Vivian Thien, Jhesseny P Kang and Kusni Ambotuwo.</p>

<p>JOHOR BAHRU: Police have busted a syndicate smuggling cough syrup, believed to be used for processing drugs, after arresting two Singaporeans at a jetty in Masai here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Johor Bahru Selatan police chief Raub Selamat said the suspects, aged 45 and 50, were arrested with five drums containing 130 litres of codeine syrup worth RM75,150 during a special operation by the Marine Police Force Region Two at 6pm.</p>
<p>He said the duo were aboard a Singapore-registered recreational fishing boat and are believed to have transported the controlled substance procured from local suppliers for sale in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>All the drums were hidden in the fish storage area of the boat.</p>
<p>We are investigating how they obtained the supply of codeine syrup, Raub said at a press conference today.</p>
<p>He said both men had entered Malaysia legally and that the seized codeine syrup will be sent for analysis.</p>
<p>Police also seized the boat worth RM270,000.</p>
<p>One of the suspects tested positive for nimetazepam.</p>

<p>GEORGE TOWN: Malaysia should stick with trusted technology and vendors for its 5G infrastructure to maintain its reputation as a secure and reliable destination for global investments, says US ambassador to Malaysia Edgard D Kagan.</p>
<p>He said Malaysia was in a strong position thanks to its existing 5G network built on trusted suppliers, making the country attractive to high-tech industries.</p>
<p>You do not want to be operating in a place where your intellectual property (IP) can be stolen.</p>
<p>And in that regard, Malaysia has a tremendous advantage because of the fact it has a 5G network built on trusted technology from trusted suppliers, he said after delivering a keynote speech at the Penang Institute here.</p>

<p>Asked if his comments hinted at the potential role of China-based tech companies in Malaysias 5G network, Kagan simply reiterated his earlier stand.</p>
<p>Im just talking about the importance of having trusted vendors, equipment and networks that can be trusted.</p>
<p>Kagan said protecting IP rights was critical for Malaysias aspirations to move up the value chain and attract investments from cutting-edge companies.</p>
<p>He said decisions on technology investments were often driven by concerns about internet protocol security rather than geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Theres a tendency to look at investment and manufacturing shifts as driven by geopolitical tension and theres some truth to that.</p>
<p>But its also worth remembering that a lot of companies started moving production out of China based on concerns about IP rights.</p>
<p>That would have happened completely separate from whatever geopolitical tension (there was).</p>
<p>Malaysia has secured over US$20 billion in investments from global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle and Infineon in the past two years.</p>
<p>Chinese firm ByteDance, TikToks parent company, has also committed US$350 million to expand its data centre operations, aiming to make Malaysia a regional AI hub.</p>
<p>Chinese tech company Huawei has been a long-time partner of U Mobile Sdn Bhd, which was recently selected to roll out Malaysias second 5G network.</p>
<p>Two analysts reportedly warned that a partnership with Huawei for the implementation of the second 5G network could deter Western tech investors, due to accusations of espionage and IP theft against the Chinese firm.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: There is an urgent need to introduce a price control policy in private hospitals to regulate charges and cost of medical treatment, a senator said today.</p>
<p>C Sivaraj said this was necessary to deal with charges that seem to be continuously on the rise at these hospitals, Bernama reported.</p>
<p>Sivaraj said Malaysia could emulate countries like Singapore that control treatment charges through the national MediShield Life scheme.</p>
<p>He also proposed the introduction of an affordable basic insurance plan, with lower fees, to help the M40 and B40 groups who are increasingly affected by this rise in health insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Countries like Germany and the Netherlands have long practised this method, he said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sivaraj said Malaysia should consider implementing a national health insurance scheme, based on the concept of risk pooling like in Singapore, to ensure all citizens receive adequate basic health protection.</p>
<p>Health is a human right, not a commodity. We must act immediately to protect the people and ensure the countrys healthcare system remains resilient, he said.</p>
<p>He called on the government to curb the migration of specialist doctors in service to the private sector by increasing salaries, perks and career opportunities.</p>
<p>Recently, the Galen Centre for Health and Social Policy had slammed Bank Negara Malaysia over its late directive for insurance and takaful operators to review their repricing strategies following an outcry over the sudden increase of 40-70% in medical insurance premiums from next year.</p>
<p>It said BNMs response only came after a public backlash and numerous reports that people were terminating their policies, further burdening the public healthcare service.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Thai police have dismantled a major cybercrime operation involving illicit activities worth 3.6 billion baht (RM466.7 million), conducted through illegal shell companies and nominee accounts.</p>
<p>Theeraphas Yungyuen of the Central Investigation Bureau said investors primarily from China and Malaysia hired 14 accounting firms to register corporate entities and open bank accounts for illegal activities, Bernama reported.</p>
<p>Theeraphas said eight Malaysian suspects were identified in a nationwide operation last month for alleged involvement in registering shell companies to facilitate money laundering and manage proceeds from technology-related crimes.</p>
<p>Of the eight Malaysian suspects, two have been arrested, while arrest warrants have been issued for the remaining six who are believed to be abroad, likely in Malaysia or Cambodia, he said.</p>
<p>He said 314 bank accounts, with a total transaction value exceeding 3.6 billion baht, were seized.</p>
<p>Police believe that lawyers, accountants and authorised representatives involved in the registration process also facilitated the illegal activities.</p>
<p>Theeraphas said investigations also revealed a broader network comprising 198 corporate entities and 695 individuals, comprising 37 foreign nationals and 658 Thai citizens.</p>
<p>He said the suspects typically formed relationships with Thai women posing as girlfriends, wives or close friends, who would then be tasked with recruiting individuals to open mule accounts or assemble account packages.</p>
<p>These accounts were sold to criminal networks involved in call centre scams, online gambling or money laundering schemes.</p>
<p>The group is believed to be one of the first to organise and supply corporate accounts for such illicit purposes.</p>
<p>Their use of internet banking allowed them to exploit regulatory loopholes, making the accounts operable for illegal transactions without immediate detection, he said.</p>
<p>Theeraphas said the two Malaysian suspects arrested are currently in CIB custody for further investigation while Thai police are coordinating with Malaysian authorities to locate the remaining six suspects.</p>
<p>The two arrested individuals will face charges of collaborating to procure mule accounts and acting as brokers for accounts linked to money laundering. Arrest warrants have been issued for the six others, but they have not re-entered Thailand, he said.</p>

<p>PARIS: French prime minister Michel Barnier will resign on Thursday after far-right and leftist lawmakers voted to topple his government, plunging the euro zones second-largest economy deeper into political crisis.</p>
<p>Barnier, a veteran politician and former European Union Brexit negotiator, will be the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history after he hands in his resignation at around 10am. No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidous in 1962.</p>
<p>The political turmoil further weakens an EU already reeling from the implosion of Germanys coalition government, and comes weeks before US president-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>The hard left and far right punished Barnier in a no-confidence vote on Wednesday evening for trying to push an unpopular budget through an unruly hung parliament without a vote. The draft budget had sought 60 billion (US$63 billion) in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit.</p>
<p>Barniers resignation caps weeks of tensions over the budget, which Marine Le Pens far-right National Rally said was too harsh on working people.</p>
<p>It also further weakens the standing of president Emmanuel Macron, who precipitated the ongoing crisis with an ill-fated decision to call a snap election in June.</p>
<p>Macron, who faces growing calls to resign, has a mandate until 2027 and cannot be pushed out.</p>
<p>Still, the long-running political debacle has left him a diminished figure. An online poll carried out just after the no-confidence motion showed 64% of voters want Macron to resign.</p>
<p>The main culprit for the current situation is Emmanuel Macron, Le Pen told TF1 TV late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The dissolution (of parliament in June) and censorship (of the government) are the consequence of his policies and of the considerable divide which exists today between him and the French.</p>
<p>A small majority of voters approved parliament bringing down Barnier, but many were still worried about its economic and political consequence, the Toluna Harris Interactive poll for RTL broadcaster showed.</p>
<p><strong>Budget turmoil</strong></p>
<p>France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a US-style government shutdown.</p>
<p>Three sources told Reuters that Macron aimed to install a new prime minister swiftly, with one saying he wanted to name Barniers replacement before a ceremony to reopen the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, which Trump is due to attend.</p>
<p>However, any new prime minister will face the same challenges as Barnier in getting bills, including the 2025 budget, adopted by a divided parliament. There can be no new parliamentary election before July.</p>
<p>Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated, SocGen analysts said in a note.</p>
<p>Political uncertainty is likely to dampen both investment and consumer spending.</p>
<p>The political uncertainty has already been unnerving investors in French sovereign bonds and stocks for weeks.</p>
<p>The risk premium investors demand to hold French debt rather than German Bunds stood close to its highest level in over 12 years on Thursday.</p>
<p>French conservative politician Xavier Bertrand said he felt a mix of anger and shame over the no-confidence vote.</p>
<p>Its as if the two extremes, (the hard left) France Unbowed and the National Rally, have become the centre of political life, he told BFM TV.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: A Sarawakian company and its director have pleaded not guilty to 60 charges related to conducting refuelling operations without a valid ground handling licence.</p>
<p>A licence from the Malaysian Aviation Commission is required for anyone providing ground handling services in Malaysia, including aircraft refuelling.</p>
<p>The charges, filed by Mavcom at the Kuching sessions court yesterday, allege that BCS Aviation (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd and its director, Robert Song, had committed the offences at the North Pan Hangar, Kuching International Airport, between July 29 and August 18, 2019.</p>
<p>The company and Song face 30 offences each under Section 37(1) of the Malaysian Aviation Commission Act 2015. Song is also charged under Section 92(2)(b) of Act 771 as the companys director.</p>
<p>If convicted, they face a maximum fine of RM1 million or up to three years imprisonment, or both, for each offence.</p>
<p>The court granted Song bail of RM30,000 in two sureties, while BCS Aviations representative, Akim Matrang, was required to post a bond of RM5,000 per case for attendance.</p>
<p>Deputy public prosecutor Nor Azhari Yusof prosecuted, while Azrin Ahmat and Samuel Bong represented BCS Aviation and Song.</p>
<p>The court set Jan 16 for case management.</p>
<p>Separately, Mavcom executive chairman Saripuddin Kasim said in a statement that complying with industry laws and regulations is essential for operating in the aviation sector.</p>
<p>Aviation players must secure all necessary regulatory approvals before commencing operations, as mandated by both Malaysian law and international standards, he said.</p>
<p>Mavcom remains committed to safeguarding the industry and will take firm action against any violations.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Najib Razaks bid to adduce fresh evidence at the hearing of his appeal for leave to commence judicial review proceedings over a purported royal decree placing him under house arrest has been postponed.</p>
<p>Senior federal counsel Shamsul Bolhassan told the Court of Appeal today the adjournment was necessary to enable the government to verify the authenticity of a document produced in the case.</p>
<p>Shamsul told a three-member bench chaired by Justice Azizah Nawawi, the Attorney-Generals Chambers only received the cause papers from Najibs solicitors yesterday.</p>
<p>We need time to verify an exhibit. That document was not signed or sealed, he told the bench in a packed courtroom.</p>
<p>Also on the panel hearing the application were Justices Azhahari Kamal Ramli and Firuz Jaffril.</p>
<p>Lawyer Shafee Abdullah, representing Najib, asked for the court to fix a short hearing date due to the urgency of the matter.</p>
<p>This bench has been identified to hear the application, he said.</p>
<p>Azizah, however, denied this, saying that the application was assigned to the present panel as it was already scheduled to sit today.</p>
<p>We have no discretion to insist on hearing the case as that is decided by the court registry. This matter is adjourned to another day, she said.</p>
<p>Azizah said a case management will be held to determine the applications new hearing date.</p>
<p>The High Court in Kuala Lumpur had on July 3 dismissed Najibs application for leave, and the Court of Appeal was scheduled to hear Najibs appeal from that ruling this afternoon.</p>
<p>However, on Tuesday, Najib filed the fresh evidence application to strengthen his bid for leave to bring judicial review proceedings over a purported supplementary order issued by former king Al-Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah placing him under house arrest for the remainder of his jail term.</p>
<p>In an affidavit affirmed in support of the application, Shafee said Najib had no intention to delay todays appeal hearing. However, the new evidence was only recently obtained by Najibs son, Nizar.</p>
<p>Shafee also asked the appeals court to issue a protective order to preserve the confidentiality of the additional evidence due to its sensitive nature.</p>
<p>He said all criteria prescribed by law for introducing fresh evidence at the appellate stage have also been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Court documents sighted by FMT revealed that the application was also accompanied by an affidavit affirmed on Dec 2 by Nizar, the Peramu Jaya assemblyman and a Pahang executive councillor.</p>
<p>The High Court had previously ruled that Najib had failed to show he had an arguable case to warrant a full hearing of his proposed judicial review application.</p>
<p>Justice Amarjeet Singh said the statements contained in affidavits filed by Najib, Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and the partys vice-president, Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail, were hearsay and inadmissible as evidence.</p>
<p>On Feb 2, the Federal Territories Pardons Board announced that Najibs prison sentence in his SRC International case had been halved from 12 years to six, and his fine reduced from RM210 million to RM50 million.</p>
<p>The former prime minister is currently serving his jail sentence at Kajang prison.</p>
<p>In his leave application filed in the High Court on April 1, he claimed the former king had, during an FTPB meeting on Jan 29, also issued a supplementary decree allowing him to serve the remainder of his reduced jail term under house arrest.</p>
<p>He said the FTPB had omitted to announce the terms of the supplementary decree, and that the government was in contempt for not complying with it.</p>
<p>He wants the court to compel the government to execute the supplementary decree, if it exists, by placing him under house arrest.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian Border Control and Protection Agency (AKPS) is expected to take over all operations at 114 national entry points in January 2026, the Dewan Rakyat was told today.</p>
<p>Deputy home minister Shamsul Anuar Nasarah said AKPSs operations would begin on Feb 1, 2025, Bernama reported.</p>
<p>This will involve 22 entry points, with the immigration, customs, quarantine and security complex (ICQS) in Rantau Panjang, Kelantan, as the first location.</p>
<p>AKPS is expected to take over operations at all 114 active entry points in the country in January 2026.</p>
<p>We are still in the process of increasing staffing.</p>
<p>Shamsul said AKPS would be the frontline control agency for border entry points and ports, responsible for integrated control and inspection duties at land, sea and air entry points.</p>
<p>He was replying to a supplementary question from Takiyuddin Hassan (PN-Kota Bharu) who wanted to know the staff strength and assets for AKPS as well as figures for human trafficking cases.</p>
<p>Regarding human trafficking, Shamsul said 479 cases with 911 arrests were recorded from 2021 till August this year.</p>
<p>He said the Taring Wawasan operation was going on now at the border areas of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan.</p>
<p>From 2023 to Sept 30, 2024, Op Taring Wawasan recorded 3,031 cases and 4,216 arrests, with seizures worth RM346.85 million involving offences related to the smuggling of drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, petrol, diesel and illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the agency was set up to allow for better coordination among the various departments and improve integrity.</p>
<p>In January, it was announced that Bukit Amans internal security and public order department director Hazani Ghazali would lead the agency.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had directed all ministries and departments to deploy officers and personnel at the countrys borders to carry out AKPS-related tasks.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Malaysia may have reached a critical stage in its food production  the country had to import 60% of its supply in 2022, according to data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DoSM).</p>
<p>For instance, as DoSM data shows, fewer agricultural items registered growth in local production in 2022 compared with 2021.</p>
<p>In 2022, local production of 24 such items rose, compared with 28 in 2021.</p>
<p>In his policy brief for 2024, senior visiting fellow at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Larry Wong said there is also a need to incorporate nutrition, diet and health factors into long-term food security within a more holistic national approach and response.</p>
<p>Life expectancy in Malaysia currently stands at about 75 years but the final 10 years, on average, are non-healthy years. Thus, what we know as average healthy life expectancy is severely compromised, leaving it closer to 65 years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCD) is alarming. Nearly 2.3 million adults in Malaysia live with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or obesity.</p>
<p>About 16% of adults have diabetes, 29% have hypertension and 33% have high cholesterol.</p>
<p>The country is in a vulnerable position, but all is not lost.</p>
<p>Becoming more resilient can help Malaysians reverse the tide, and the 13th Malaysia Plan presents and opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>The problem at hand</strong></p>
<p>Malaysias population is projected to rise from 34.1 million currently to 45 million in 2050  a 32% increase in just one generation.</p>
<p>In the face of this and other challenges, how do we feed more people without using more land and water while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving climate resilience?</p>
<p>As we rethink Malaysias long-term plan to ensure food security, we will have to consider innovative strategies and policies that build on past gains, although that may also often require on-course corrections.</p>
<p>We must also not forget the importance of leveraging on collaboration among government, industry and communities to create a balanced and holistic approach to address and manage the multifaceted dimensions of food and nutrition security.</p>
<p><strong>Hanging by a thread</strong></p>
<p>Many factors, from weather patterns to politics, have an impact on food security, making it highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>For instance, Malaysia was essentially an agriculture-based economy when it gained independence, but the shift of priorities to manufacturing led to a decline in productivity on the farm.</p>
<p>This has disrupted food supply, leading to inflation.</p>
<p>Other challenges, such as climate change, have only made things worse.</p>
<p>The five major food crises from 1972 to 2023  caused by severe weather conditions, financial turmoil and rising prices  only underscore our vulnerability.</p>
<p>For instance, food security expert Fatimah Mohamed Arshad pointed out, in 2008 and 2023, Malaysia struggled to produce enough rice to feed the population.</p>
<p>Production continued to decline despite heavy subsidies and numerous market interventions, she recalled.</p>
<p><strong>What we need: Shaping demand</strong></p>
<p>The hope is that including a roadmap for radical change under the 13th Malaysia Plan can shape demand and supply, thus improving food security.</p>
<p>However, it wont be a walk in the park.</p>
<p>For a start complete self-sufficiency, and a lower import bill, while ideal, are not quite good indicators of food security. The next best thing, according to experts, is to tackle the problems that can lead to a crisis.</p>
<p>For instance, raising production that can better meet the demand for safe and nutritious food may improve security, in all its dimensions.</p>
<p>Given that consumption patterns are also driven by availability and physical access to sufficient food as well as economic conditions, transforming the way food is produced, processed, delivered and consumed is key to ensuring a sufficient, safe and sustainable food ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring safe and adequate supply</strong></p>
<p>Fatimah said making a major revamp a key objective of the 13th Malaysia Plan is essential to ensure food security, resilience and sustainability in Malaysias food ecosystem.</p>
<p>The landscape will become more volatile and complex as new challenges such as climate instability, disruptive technology, geopolitical shifts and dynamic changes leave an impact on consumer behaviour, she said.</p>
<p>The answer, she said, is to commit seriously to R&amp;D to improve productivity through the use of advanced technology in farming and marketing while encouraging young entrepreneurs to drive the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>She said Malaysias emergence as a regional data centre hub for tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle now gives the country the opportunity to be a forerunner in technology-smart and climate-smart agriculture in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Using innovation to feed the nation</strong></p>
<p>Innovation is key to taking the country to the next level and the 13th Malaysia Plan should provide the strategy to achieve this objective.</p>
<p>John Tey of Universiti Putra Malaysia said agricultural innovation will be a game changer.</p>
<p>But, he pointed out, innovation requires talent. Talent is the most valuable resource that drives progress, he told FMT.</p>
<p>For instance, Tey said, individuals with entrepreneurial skills can inspire and help farmers with sustainable farming models, while those with technical expertise are good at supporting farmers with operational efficiency, technological access and market insights.</p>
<p>Those who excel independently can guide farmers in terms of resource management and problem-solving, he said.</p>
<p>These talented individuals are like leaders who inspire change. They see opportunities where others see challenges. They have an exceptional ability to spot business opportunities and mobilise collective action, he added.</p>
<p>Tey said talents also attract external support such as private sector investment and contributions from influential community figures.</p>
<p>As he pointed out, more forward-thinking transformative agents are needed to accelerate agricultural growth sustainably.</p>
<p><strong>Work together</strong></p>
<p>Experts have pointed out that food security strategies must be implemented in a more integrated manner, and collaboration among government, industry players and research institutions is key to providing solutions that will benefit the food security agenda in the country.</p>
<p>Its impact on both production and consumption helps public and private sector efforts to transform the food ecosystem to deliver all that is needed to meet the objectives of the sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>Wide public input is also helpful in ensuring success of this transformation process and Malaysians can share their ideas at <a href="https://rmk13.ekonomi.gov.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;">https://rmk13.ekonomi.gov.my/</span></a></p>

<p>SEPANG: Air Selangor is not to blame for the large-scale unscheduled water disruption that affected Selangor and Kuala Lumpur in July, says the National Water Services Commission (SPAN).</p>
<p>SPAN chairman Charles Santiago said the incident was caused by factories polluting two rivers feeding four water treatment plants.</p>
<p>This was why SPAN could not take action on the utility company over the issue, which affected hundreds of areas across the Klang Valley.</p>
<p>Air Selangor had to handle the problem, it did not cause it, he said at a press conference here today.</p>
<p>The Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) had called for stringent action against Air Selangor over the water disruptions, accusing SPAN of not holding the company accountable.</p>
<p>Santiago said SPAN has recommended that existing laws be enforced more strictly on premises like factories. He said physical checks on these premises should be conducted every time a factory applies to renew its business licence.</p>
<p>He also said the environment department must tighten its inspections before approving Environmental Impact Assessment reports, as well as its control of waste discharge into rivers.</p>
<p>SPAN also requests that the Selangor government conduct inspections on all factories or business premises involved in plastic waste recycling, particularly in high-risk areas, he said.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: An insurance agent, whose 37-year-old brother has been put on death row in Singapore for a drug trafficking offence, has urged the Asean Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) to intervene.</p>
<p>With support from Amnesty International Malaysia, Angelia Pranthaman hopes that AICHR, backed by the government, will advocate for her brother Pannir Selvams death sentence to be commuted.</p>
<p>We are requesting for AICHR to intervene and for the foreign ministry to engage with the attorney-general and Singaporean president to ensure the cooperation given by Pannir to the police is recognised as grounds to commute his death sentence, Angelia told a press conference at Solaris Dutamas today.</p>
<p>She added that Pannir had consistently cooperated with Singaporean authorities and provided vital information that contributed to investigation of drug syndicates and arrests of the suspects involved. However, she said his contributions were not fairly recognised and were dismissed.</p>
<p>Time is very crucial. The execution notice could be scheduled anytime, so we are pleading to the relevant authorities in Malaysia to secure the commutation of his death sentence through a certificate of substantial assistance or other diplomatic engagements.</p>
<p>I ask for your (AICHR) support in giving Pannir a second chance, she said.</p>
<p>A certificate of substantive assistance would allow the courts the discretion to take him off death row and impose life imprisonment and caning instead.</p>
<p>Pannir was sentenced to death after he was convicted on June 27, 2017 by the Singapore High Court for trafficking in 51.84g of diamorphine at the Woodlands Checkpoint on Sept 3, 2014.</p>
<p>A letter from the Singapore president refusing clemency and the notification of execution, both dated May 17, 2019, were sent to his family, notifying them of his scheduled execution on May 24, 2019.</p>
<p>However, a day before his execution, the Singapore Court of Appeal granted Pannirs application to stay his execution, enabling him to challenge the clemency process.</p>
<p>The then foreign minister Saifuddin Abdullah had said the government would help Pannir get the best legal advice on his appeal for clemency in Singapore.</p>
<p>An application to start a court challenge against the rejection of Pannirs clemency plea was heard in chambers on Feb 11, 2020. However, the bid was dismissed by the High Court the next day.</p>
<p>Another appeal by Pannir to challenge the clemency process and also the public prosecutors decision not to issue him a certificate of substantive assistance, was rejected by the Court of Appeal on Nov 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Since then, Pannirs family has called for a review of the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureaus (CNB) decision not to issue the certificate.</p>
<p>The argument for the certificate was based on the fact that he had given CNB information which led to the arrest of another drug trafficker.</p>
<p>Amnesty research and advocacy officer Nicole Fong said in June this year, the Singapore home affairs ministry reviewed the practice of providing notification of execution, to shorten the notice period for those who had previously been issued an execution warrant and had received a stay after half of their notification period had passed.</p>
<p>We fear that Pannir will be served with a shortened four days execution notice, which would severely impact him and his family, as well as further reduce the possibility of any last-minute recourse, she said.</p>
<p>Angelia submitted a memorandum, while Nicole presented 375 public petitions appealing for clemency on behalf of Pannir, to AICHRs Malaysian representative, Edmund Bon, today.</p>
<p>Our legal team will be reviewing the case and looking at how the judgments in Singapore have or have not reflected the arguments that were made, and whether there is room for diplomatic or humanitarian intervention in the case, Bon said.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the principles of sovereignty must be respected, Bon expressed hope that, with the support of the Prime Ministers Office, the home ministry and the foreign ministry, a solution that upholds and respects human rights principles could be reached.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: A parliamentary committee has urged the government against proceeding with the revamped National Service Training Programme (PLKN 3.0).</p>
<p>The committee, which includes five government MPs, said the revived programme lacked clear objectives and goals, describing this as a legacy issue from its past iterations.</p>
<p>Its chairman, Indera Mahkota MP Saifuddin Abdullah, said the programme would also incur high costs for the government, and questioned the extent of its positive effects which he said could be achieved through existing programmes at educational institutions.</p>
<p>This parliamentary select committee proposes that the government not proceed with PLKN 3.0.</p>
<p>If the government does intend to go ahead with it, the committee is of the view that a thorough and in-depth study must be held first, he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Saifuddin also raised concerns over the PLKN 3.0 module, which is 70% on basic military training and 30% on patriotism.</p>
<p>He said part of the military-related module had nothing to do with basic military training, while other content could be presented at existing education institutions.</p>
<p>If PLKN 3.0 goes ahead, its goal and module must be based on military training or at least partly. But the question is this: does Malaysia really need such a programme?</p>
<p>The backbencher members of the committee are Stampin MP Chong Chieng Jen, Batu Gajah MP V Sivakumar, Igan MP Ahmad Johnie Zawawi, Balik Pulau MP Bakhtiar Wan Chik, and Jempol MP Shamshulkahar Deli.</p>
<p>The others are Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, Maran MP Ismail Abd Muttalib and Bagan Serai MP Idris Ahmad.</p>
<p>PLKN 3.0 will be implemented in stages from next month. It will first be held at two military camps in Kuala Lumpur and Pahang, then expanded to 13 other camps nationwide, before being fully implemented in 2026.</p>
<p>The government has allocated RM50 million for the programme next year.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Dr Mahathir Mohamad unilaterally decided not to proceed with the applications to review and interpret the International Court of Justices 2008 decision on Batu Puteh, according to the royal commission of inquiry (RCI).</p>
<p>The RCI said the then prime minister had written to the solicitor-general on May 21, 2018, stating that to my view, this effort need not be continued, referring to the ICJ applications.</p>
<p>The solicitor-general then informed Singapore that Malaysia would be dropping both legal applications, the commission said in its declassified report released today.</p>
<p>The RCI said Singapore was informed of this at 9am on May 23, 2018. The Cabinet only met at 9.30am the same day and discussed the issue later in the meeting under other matters.</p>
<div class='youtube-container'></div>
<p>It added that the Cabinet in its meeting simply confirmed Mahathirs views and opinions as the prime minister.</p>
<p>The solicitor-general informed Singapore of Malaysias intention to drop the two applications based on Mahathirs letter on May 21, not the Cabinets decision when it met on May 23, said the RCI report.</p>
<p>It also cited a letter from the solicitor-general to the prime minister on May 24, 2018, which stated that she had informed Singapore based on Mahathirs letter on May 21.</p>
<p>Mahathir did not question, deny or correct the contents of the solicitor-generals letter to him to explain that his May 21 letter was merely his personal opinion, not an order or decision.</p>
<p>Based on these reasons, the commission cannot accept Mahathirs claim that the May 21 letter was merely his personal opinion. Conversely, the letter was a decision, said the RCI.</p>
<p>Mahathir had denied acting unilaterally in deciding not to proceed with the legal applications, saying he did not make a decision until he put it before the Cabinet.</p>
<p>He also said he consulted several experts, including five senior lawyers from the UK, who took the view that Malaysia had a weak case.</p>
<p>Mahathir said international legal expert Brendan Plant, who was appointed as a consultant by Putrajaya, had told him Malaysia lacked the silver bullet needed to secure victory in the case.</p>
<p>However, the RCI said Mahathir was never advised by the Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) or government-appointed consultants that Malaysia had a very weak case in its territorial claim to Batu Puteh.</p>
<p>The commission said Plant also denied ever meeting Mahathir one-on-one prior to a briefing on the case.</p>
<p>During RCI proceedings, Plant said his mention of Malaysia lacking a silver bullet was to show that there was no guarantee of a win at the ICJ.</p>
<p>I might have been asked (by Mahathir) about the prospects for success. I restated our position that theres an arguable case, that we have a credible basis for bringing the claim that has merit but, of course, we cant guarantee a win.</p>
<p>I cant say that theres a silver bullet that will 100% guarantee the ICJs findings would be in our favour, but there was a credible plausible case to present. Thats the truism of litigation throughout the world, he said, according to the declassified RCI report.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The human resources ministry has urged more employers to implement flexible working arrangements (FWA) in their companies.</p>
<p>Its minister Steven Sim said as of October, close to 3,000 companies with more than 50,000 employees in Penang, the Klang Valley, and Johor Bahru had joined workshops by TalentCorp to learn more about FWA and how to implement it.</p>
<p>Many companies actually come up to us and say they want to implement the policy but are unsure of how to go about it, and are worried they will be in breach of employment laws, Sim told reporters after launching the guidelines for FWA at M Resort Hotel here.</p>
<p>He said by implementing the policy, companies would be able to remain competitive in retaining talent, reducing operational costs, providing a conducive working environment, and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Sim said its implementation would also lead to improvements in other areas, such as traffic congestion and stress management among employees.</p>
<p>He said TalentCorp would conduct a study of companies that carried out FWA in the next six months to understand what impacts or issues they faced.</p>
<p>The guidelines launched today included FWA objectives, benefits, implementation methods, approval process, responsibilities for employers and employees, appeal process, and types of jobs suitable for the policy.</p>
<p>In April, Sim said workers could apply to their employers for FWA based on time, days, and location of work according to Sections 60P and 60Q of the Employment Act 1955.</p>
<p>He said that employers must provide feedback on such applications within 60 days of receipt as well as reasons for rejection.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Najib Razak told the High Court here that fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho (Jho Low) exploited his trust, resulting in the former prime minister being falsely portrayed as complicit in the 1MDB fiasco.</p>
<p>Denying former CEO Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmis claims that he and Low had a close relationship, Najib said the perception arose due to Lows presence at his home.</p>
<p>While I do not deny that on certain occasions Jho Low was present at my home, it is important to understand the context of my interactions with him during that time.</p>
<p>My confidence in him arose from the compelling image he projected as a highly capable and well-connected individual, Najib said, pointing out that Low is well connected to the Terengganu and Middle Eastern royal families.</p>
<p>The ex-PM also said Low helped Malaysia bring back students studying in Egypt when the Arab Spring protests broke out and also helped to secure from Saudi Arabia an increase in Malaysias haj pilgrimage quotas.</p>
<p>What set this slightly pudgy young man apart was his remarkable charisma and an extraordinary ability to navigate diverse and influential circles and consistently position himself as someone who could deliver results.</p>
<p>Just because I trusted Jho Low, it does not mean that I gave him instructions to act as a go-between for myself and the management or directors of 1MDB.</p>
<p>If he (Low) brought any (company shareholder) resolution to my home, I would question him, said Najib.</p>
<p>He said it was Shahrol who was close to Low, as the former 1MDB CEO visited the Penang businessmans home with several other members of the companys staff and a former AmBank banker.</p>
<p>Shahrol admitted he cooked nasi goreng for Jho Low and Joanna (Yu), made soup for him. I never cooked anything for him, said Najib.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing to hide on Saudi donation, says Najib</strong></p>
<p>Najib also insisted he never hid the fact that he had received a purported Saudi donation, adding that he had spent the money on corporate social responsibility activities. All transactions were properly recorded, he said.</p>
<p>I issued cheques, not cash. If I wanted to steal (from 1MDB) as the prosecution claims, I would not have brought back (the money) and told BNM (Bank Negara Malaysia) about it. This would be bordering on insanity, said Najib.</p>
<p>Najib is standing trial on 25 charges of abuse of power and money laundering over funds amounting to RM2.28 billion which were deposited into his AmBank accounts between February 2011 and December 2014.</p>
<p>The hearing continues before Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah on Friday.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: A new judge is set to preside over the corruption case brought against Kinabatangan MP Bung Moktar Radin and his wife, Zizie Izette Abdul Samad.</p>
<p>Sessions court judge Rosli Ahmad, who took over conduct of the case from Rozina Ayob, allotted seven days in April and May next year to hear the duos defence to charges of corruption and abetment involving a RM150 million Felcra investment.</p>
<p>The trial is set to continue from April 9 to 11 and 14 to 15, and May 5 to 6.</p>
<p>Rosli also ordered the couple to place RM100,000 bail with one surety each and impounded their passports pending the disposal of the trial.</p>
<p>Deputy public prosecutors Law Chin How, Fadly Zambry, and Maziah Mohaide appeared for the prosecution.</p>
<p>Lawyers Ashok Athimulan and Ridha Abdah Subri appeared for Bung, while K Kumaraendran acted for Zizie.</p>
<p>Kumaraendran said the couple intended to testify in their defence from the witness box. However, he said no decision had been made as to whether they would provide witness statements as their examination-in-chief.</p>
<p>We want to go through the Court of Appeal judgment which we have yet to obtain before making a decision, he said.</p>
<p>The prosecution and the defence returned to the trial court today after the Court of Appeal on Nov 18 reversed Bung and Zizies acquittal by the High Court.</p>
<p>Justice Zaini Mazlan, who read the appellate courts broad grounds of decision, said the revision application filed by the couple in the High Court was akin to an appeal.</p>
<p>It is an interlocutory application masked as an appeal, said Zaini, adding that it amounted to a disruption of the trial process.</p>
<p>Also on the panel hearing the appeal were Justices Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Noorin Badaruddin.</p>
<p>Bung, then non-executive chairman of Felcra, was charged on May 3, 2019 with two counts of receiving bribes of RM2.2 million and RM262,500 as an inducement to obtain Felcras approval to invest RM150 million in Public Mutual unit trusts.</p>
<p>He is alleged to have accepted the bribes from Public Mutuals investment agent Norhaili Madhi through Zizie at the Taman Melawati Public Bank branch between 12.30pm and 5pm on June 12, 2015.</p>
<p>He was also charged with receiving a bribe of RM337,500 from Norhaili under Zizies name at the same location on June 19, 2015.</p>
<p>Zizie faces three charges of abetting Bung in the commission of the alleged offences.</p>
<p>On Sept 2, 2022, the sessions court judge ordered the couple to enter their defence as the prosecution had established a prima facie case against them.</p>
<p>On Sept 7 last year, the High Court, hearing a revision application brought under Section 323 of the Criminal Procedure Code, acquitted the duo. However, that decision was set aside on appeal.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysias breakfast culture has been inscribed on Unescos Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>
<p>The tourism, arts and culture ministry said in a statement today that the recognition for Breakfast Culture in Malaysia: Dining Experience in a Multi-Ethnic Society was announced during the 19th Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage held in Paraguay.</p>
<p>According to the ministry, the evaluation body concluded that Malaysias breakfast culture met all the criteria outlined in Unescos 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.</p>
<p>The breakfast culture in Malaysia reflects the nations diversity, harmony, inclusivity and acceptance of its multi-ethnic society. It is an intangible cultural heritage element aligned with Unescos criteria, thus fostering social connections and showcasing Malaysias strength as a multiracial nation.</p>
<p>This recognition is expected to inspire greater efforts in safeguarding intangible heritage through collaborative initiatives of various quarters, including the government, associations and local communities, besides opening up avenues for broader cooperation across various fields, the statement read.</p>
<p>The ministry had, through the national heritage department, submitted the nomination for Malaysias breakfast culture to Unesco in March last year  the first related to food and gastronomy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the kebaya  a traditional garment beloved across Southeast Asia  was officially added to Unescos intangible cultural heritage list.</p>
<p>Malaysias prior recognition includes Mak Yong theatre in 2005, dondang sayang (2018), silat (2019), Ong Chun-Wangchuan-Wangkang ceremony (joint nomination with China, 2020), pantun (joint nomination with Indonesia, 2020), songket (2021), and Mek Mulung (2023).</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Tempers flared in the Dewan Rakyat when Speaker Johari Abdul ordered the removal of Awang Hashim (PN-Pendang) from the chambers for 10 days.</p>
<p>Johari said the suspension came after Awang failed to retract and apologise for a remark he allegedly made in a TikTok video that insulted the Speaker.</p>
<p>He referred to a TikTok post from July 18, in which Awang accused him of being unjust towards the PAS lawmaker himself and Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal (PN-Machang).</p>
<p>Johari claimed the comments, which had been brought to the attention of the lower house on Nov 6, were serious and required an immediate retraction and apology.</p>
<div class='youtube-container'></div>
<p>I sent a letter (to you) on July 22 requesting both a retraction and an apology. I even instructed the Dewan Rakyat secretary to meet with you and I sought the help of the opposition chief whip (Takiyuddin Hassan). Yet, as of today, you have not taken any action, he said.</p>
<p>The statement made in that TikTok video is not only a serious allegation but also violates the rights of MPs and dishonours this House.</p>
<p>Since you have not retracted the statement or apologised, I hereby order Pendang (Awang) to be ejected from the Dewan Rakyat for 10 days, as per Standing Order 44(2).</p>
<p>The opposition angrily objected to the decision, with Takiyuddin (PN-Kota Bharu) arguing that the Speaker could not pass judgment in matters involving himself due to a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>However, Syahredzan Johan (PH-Bangi) cited the example of judges taking action for contempt of court, arguing that a similar approach could apply in this case.</p>
<p>Hassan Karim (PH-Pasir Gudang) suggested that Awang be referred to the rights and privileges committee instead to preserve the dignity of the Dewan Rakyat and the Speakers position.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Johari stood by his decision and said former Padang Serai MP N Surendran had been suspended for six months in 2013 for allegedly insulting then Speaker Pandikar Amin Mulia outside the chambers.</p>
<p>The government had tabled a motion to suspend Surendren and a ruling was made without any debate.</p>
<p>Beluran (Ronald Kiandee) was the deputy speaker who chaired that session when the motion was tabled, he said.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Najib Razak has filed an application seeking to adduce fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal to prove the existence of a supplementary order allowing him to serve the remainder of his jail term under house arrest.</p>
<p>The former prime minister is seeking to rely on the new evidence to secure leave to commence judicial review proceedings to compel the government to execute a purported royal decree issued by former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah.</p>
<p>Afiqa Liyana Rozman was the deputy public prosecutor in the case.</p>
<p>The High Court had on July 3 dismissed Najibs application for leave, and the Court of Appeal was scheduled to hear Najibs appeal from that ruling this afternoon.</p>
<p>In an affidavit affirmed in support of the application two days ago, lawyer Shafee Abdullah said Najib had no intention to delay todays appeal hearing. However, the new evidence was only recently obtained by Najibs son, Nizar.</p>
<p>Shafee also asked the appeals court to issue a protective order to preserve the confidentiality of the additional evidence due to its sensitive nature.</p>
<p>The lawyer claimed that all criteria prescribed by law for introducing fresh evidence at the appellate stage have also been fulfilled.</p>
<p>The new evidence will prove that Najibs application for leave should be allowed as it has merit, Shafees affidavit said.</p>
<p>Court documents sighted by FMT revealed that the application was also accompanied by an affidavit affirmed on Dec 2 by Nizar, the Peramu Jaya assemblymen and a Pahang state executive councillor.</p>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur High Court had previously ruled that Najib had failed to show he had an arguable case to warrant a full hearing of his proposed judicial review application.</p>
<p>Justice Amarjeet Singh said the statements contained in affidavits filed by Najib, Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, and the partys vice-president Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail were hearsay and inadmissible as evidence.</p>
<p>On Feb 2 this year, the Federal Territories Pardons Board (FTPB) announced that Najibs prison sentence in his SRC International case had been halved from 12 years to six, and his fine reduced from RM210 million to RM50 million.</p>
<p>He is currently serving his jail sentence at Kajang prison.</p>
<p>In his leave application filed in the High Court on April 1, Najib claimed that the former king had during an FTPB meeting on Jan 29, also issued a supplementary decree allowing him to serve the remainder of his reduced jail term under house arrest.</p>
<p>The former prime minister said the FTPB had omitted to announce the terms of the supplementary decree, and that the government was in contempt for not complying with it.</p>
<p>He wants the court to compel the government to execute the supplementary decree, if it exists, by placing him under house arrest.</p>

<p>GEORGE TOWN: A former executive director and CEO of the Penang Hindu Endowments Board (PHEB) has been remanded for six days by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to assist in investigations.</p>
<p>Magistrate Siti Nurul Suhaila Baharin allowed MACCs request to remand M Ramachandran, although the anti-graft agency initially sought a seven-day remand order.</p>
<p>Ramachandrans lawyer R Roshunraj objected to the remand order at the magistrates court here, citing his clients health issues and calling the seven-day period excessive.</p>
<p>He said his client has diabetes, hypertension, and allergic rhinitis which required specialised medication.</p>
<p>He also said Ramachandran was brought for questioning from his home in Perai to the MACC office on Northam Road at 8am yesterday. He was arrested about an hour later.</p>
<p>Roshunraj said he would challenge the remand order at the High Court with a certificate of urgency as his client should not be subjected to prolonged detention.</p>
<p>We will file for a revision at the High Court as this remand period is unnecessary and excessive, especially considering my clients health conditions, he said when contacted.</p>
<p>He said MACC was investigating Ramachandran under Section 23 of the MACC Act, which involves the abuse of office or position for personal gratification.</p>
<p>Roshunraj said details of the investigation had not been disclosed but that it was believed to be linked to the alleged misuse of funds for the golden chariot project for Thaipusam.</p>
<p>FMT earlier reported that MACC was probing former PHEB chairman P Ramasamy over alleged corruption in the procurement of the golden chariot.</p>
<p>Ramasamy, who yesterday discovered that he had been banned from leaving the country, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Former research assistant Yusoff Rawther pleaded not guilty in the High Court in Kuala Lumpur to a charge of trafficking in 305gm of cannabis.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old entered his plea after the charge was re-read to him before Justice Jamil Hussin following the transfer of the case to the High Court.</p>
<p>The court set Dec 13 for case mention, reported Bernama.</p>
<p>Yusoff was charged in the magistrates court here on Sept 12 with trafficking in the drugs, but no plea was recorded as the case fell under the jurisdiction of the High Court.</p>
<p>The charge was framed under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act.</p>
<p>According to the charge sheet, Yusoff is accused of trafficking in the drugs at a car park in front of the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters at 10.15am on Sept 6.</p>
<p>Yusoff was represented by lawyer Rafique Rashid Ali, while the prosecution was handled by deputy public prosecutor Sabri Othman.</p>
<p>On Oct 9, he claimed trial in the magistrates court to a charge of possessing replica pistols.</p>
<p>According to the charge sheet, the two replica pistols were found on him near Sanada Kiara Condominium on Jalan Bukit Kiara at 9.25am on Sept 6.</p>
<p>The charge, under Section 36(1) of the Arms Act 1960, provides for imprisonment of up to one year, or a maximum fine of RM5,000, or both if convicted.</p>

<p>PUTRAJAYA: Two former directors-cum-employees of a company have been awarded approximately RM2 million in compensation after the Court of Appeal ruled they were unfairly dismissed from employment.</p>
<p>A three-member bench chaired by Justice Lee Swee Seng awarded RM893,000 to Woon Kim Choy and RM1.151 million to Chang Heng Keong, after holding it would not be feasible to reinstate them to their posts with Acexide Technology Sdn Bhd.</p>
<p>Woon, a former technical director, and Chang, an ex-project director, drew monthly salaries of RM19,000 and RM24,500, respectively, including allowances.</p>
<p>The bench also ordered Acexide Technology to pay interest of 8% per annum on the sums awarded, calculated from Aug 9, 2022 until full settlement.</p>
<p>Lee, who sat with Justices Azimah Omar and Azizul Azmi Adnan, also ordered the company to pay Woon and Chang, who had been with the company for 23 years, RM20,000 each in costs.</p>
<p>This court allows the two appeals and quashes the dismissal of their claims by the Industrial Court. We have set aside the order of the High Court and made an order for compensation in lieu of reinstatement, he said in the 37-page judgment released earlier this week.</p>
<p>The judge said Woon and Chang were workmen within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act 1967, and that the Industrial Court had jurisdiction to hear their complaints of unfair dismissal.</p>
<p>Lee added that the employer did not adduce evidence to prove their alleged misconduct and, as such, their dismissals were without just cause or excuse.</p>
<p>There was no show-cause letter nor any domestic inquiry held nor any evidence adduced at the Industrial Court to justify their dismissal, the judge said.</p>
<p>Woon and Chang, together with BH Lim were promoters of Acexide Technology when the company was incorporated in late 1996.</p>
<p>The duo went on to become shareholders as well as directors of the company. Lim, together with his son, Jovin, were the majority shareholders with 54% equity, while Woon had 10% and Chang 36%.</p>
<p>The company is involved in the installation and maintenance of fire lighting systems, trenchless technology and transportation.</p>
<p>Lim and Jovin, by sheer strength of their majority shareholding, convened an extraordinary general meeting on Nov 6, 2019 to remove both Woon and Chang as company directors.</p>
<p>The judge said shareholders possess unfettered discretion to remove directors and that judicial intervention was unwarranted as long as the removal process adhered to statutory requirements and the companys constitution.</p>
<p>However, Woon and Chang filed a complaint at the industrial relations department claiming to have been unlawfully dismissed from their employment with the company.</p>
<p>In his judgment, Lee said that although Woon and Chang were company directors, they were also employees of the company.</p>
<p>Thus, they may wear two hats  as a director under the Companies Act and as one of the most senior and highest-ranking staff of the company, reporting to the board of directors, he said.</p>
<p>He said the company had treated the duo as its employees, as evidenced by their listing in the register of employees and statutory contributions made on their behalf.</p>
<p>Lee said Woon and Changs removal as directors did not affect their status as employees of the company.</p>
<p>The appellants, as workmen, were entitled to seek the remedy of reinstatement or compensation in lieu of reinstatement as the Industrial Court had jurisdiction to hear the dispute, the judge said.</p>
<p>Gavin Jayapal and M Kausalyaa appeared for the appellants while Khoo Wai Tuck and Wayne Lim acted for the company.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Warisan has distanced itself from its vice-president Terrence Siambuns proposal that former chief justice Richard Malanjum be appointed as the next governor of Sabah.</p>
<p>Warisan secretary-general Loretto Padua Jr said Siambuns statement was his personal view and not the partys stand.</p>
<p>We respect his views but what is important now is that we focus on the issues the people of Sabah face.</p>
<p>Warisan has never discussed the issue of the next Sabah governor and fully trusts in the Yang di-Pertuan Agongs wisdom to choose what is best for Sabah and Sabahans, he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Siambun said Malanjum was suitable for the Sabah governors post as he was a distinguished Sabahan with an exceptional track record which displayed his commitment to justice and unity.</p>
<p>He added that having Malanjum as governor would reflect Sabahs identity as a harmoniously diverse state and would further foster unity.</p>
<p>The tenure of the current Sabah governor Juhar Mahiruddin expires at the end of the year. A former Kinabatangan MP from Umno, Juhar has been the Bornean states governor since 2011.</p>
<p>Malanjum was the first East Malaysian to be named as head of the Malaysian judiciary after Pakatan Harapan took control of the federal government in 2018. He retired in April 2019.</p>
<p>During the 2020 Sabah state election, Malanjum campaigned for the Warisan Plus coalition, which at the time comprised Warisan and PH.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Sabah Umno has denied being the mastermind behind the expos of alleged bribery involving multiple assemblymen over mining leases in the Bornean state.</p>
<p>Sabah Umno information chief Suhaimi Nasir said the party only found out about the case through news reports.</p>
<p>How can people say Umno is involved when everything was shared by the whistleblower through Malaysiakini? We are just observers and arent even sure of the real situation.</p>
<p>I deny that Umno was involved. We have no clue (about the allegations), Suhaimi told FMT.</p>
<p>He also warned that the scandal could hinder Sabah from wooing investors, and called for strong action, especially as several state ministers were linked to the allegations.</p>
<p>Academic Tajuddin Rasdi had asked if there were hidden hands involved in the surfacing of the allegations, given that Sabah would hold its state elections next year.</p>
<p>Sabah Umno Youth meanwhile had urged Hajiji Noor to step down as chief minister in light of the scandal, to allow for an independent and transparent investigation to be held.</p>
<p>Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah Youth however said that such calls were baseless as the videos did not implicate Hajiji, the Gagasan Rakyat president.</p>
<p>Last night, Hajiji said his state government had never issued mining leases despite videos implicating assemblymen allegedly discussing bribes for project licences.</p>
<p>In the videos published on Malaysiakini, the purported businessman whistleblower is heard talking about funds given to Sabah officials for mining or prospecting licences.</p>
<p>He is believed to have recorded secret videos demanding his money back from certain assemblymen after the state government allegedly withdrew the licences.</p>
<p>Hajiji said the group behind the videos had applied for leases in nearly one million acres, with a significant portion of this area consisting of totally protected zones, water catchment areas, and conservation areas.</p>
<p>The Gabungan Rakyat Sabah chairman said the videos were only circulated after the groups application failed.</p>
<p>However, Suhaimi said immediate action such as Hajijis resignation was necessary to preserve Sabahs reputation, warning GRS that it risked losing the peoples trust.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: The royal commission of inquiry (RCI) on Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge has recommended that a police report be filed against former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for cheating.</p>
<p>The RCIs declassified report on its findings was released on the Parliament website today, although many of its recommendations were redacted.</p>
<p>Among the unredacted recommendations was that the RCIs secretary file a police report against Mahathir to make way for a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>A criminal investigation can be initiated under Section 415(b) of the Penal Code (for cheating), punishable under Section 417, as well as under Section 418 of the same code, said the report.</p>
<div class='youtube-container'></div>
<p>Section 415(b) relates to the offence of intentionally deceiving a person to induce him or her to act or omit an act which is likely to cause damage or harm to another person.</p>
<p>Putrajaya filed an application on Feb 3, 2017 to review the International Court of Justices (ICJ) decision, handed down nine years earlier, to award Singapore sovereignty over Batu Puteh.</p>
<p>The ICJ awarded Middle Rocks to Malaysia, while the ownership of South Ledge, situated about 4km from Batu Puteh, was left for determination based on the delimitation of territorial waters.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2017, Putrajaya filed an application to interpret the ICJs judgment to address its ambiguities and implications, particularly regarding the status of South Ledge.</p>
<p>However, upon wresting control of Putrajaya at the general election in May 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government, with Mahathir as prime minister, withdrew both applications before they came up for hearing in June 2018.</p>
<p>The report said that Mahathir had likely acted deliberately to influence the Cabinet to discontinue the applications despite the views of international consultants who said they had a reasonable likelihood of success.</p>
<p>The commission believes that an investigation under Section 418 is warranted based on the facts indicating that he deceived the government, fully aware that his actions could potentially result in wrongful loss to the government.</p>
<p>Section 418 of the Penal Code relates to the offence of cheating with the knowledge that wrongful loss may be thereby caused to a person whose interest the offender is bound to protect.</p>
<p>The report said that as prime minister, Mahathir was responsible for the nation and required at all times to preserve, safeguard, and defend its interests and sovereignty.</p>
<p>By deciding not to pursue both applications, Mahathir caused wrongful loss to the government, it said.</p>
<p>However, two members of the commission  retired apex court judge Zainun Ali and legal expert Faridah Jalil  said Mahathirs decision not to proceed with the applications was a mere dereliction of duty and did not amount to a criminal offence.</p>
<p>The other RCI members are lawyer Baljit Singh Sidhu, former Universiti Malaya faculty of law dean Johan Shamsuddin Sabaruddin, Johor state financial officer Ridha Abd Kadir, and director of the marine department southern region Dickson Dollah. Ex-chief justice Raus Sharif is commission chairman.</p>
<p>The classified final report was submitted by Raus to Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ibrahim at Istana Negara on Aug 12.</p>
<p><strong>Other recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The RCI however did not recommend filing a civil suit for tort of misfeasance in public office against Mahathir due to the six-year limitation period for the action.</p>
<p>The commission also did not recommend that Malaysia file a fresh request for interpretation to the ICJ, though it was able to do so.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: A female Chinese national was arrested by police yesterday afternoon to assist in investigations into the murder of her 49-year-old compatriot, who was stabbed in a restaurant in Cheras last week.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur police chief Rusdi Isa said the 34-year-old suspect was arrested at KL Sentral at 4.30pm yesterday.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has expressed disappointment over the delay and issues in implementing two of the nations key digital transformation projects  MyDigital ID and the second 5G network.</p>
<p>He said the matter was raised during the National Council of Digital Economy and Fourth Industrial Revolution meeting yesterday, Utusan Malaysia reported.</p>
<p>Anwar, who is also finance minister, said that the complex issues discussed during the meeting had tested his patience.</p>
<p>Our expectations may be high, but the proper implementation of MyDigital ID has been delayed by nearly a year.</p>
<p>Similarly, the rollout of the second 5G network and negotiations between Digital Nasional Bhd (DNB) and telecommunications companies have also stalled.</p>
<p>Reminders issued a year ago remain unanswered by both parties, which caused me to lose patience, he told a staff assembly of the finance ministry today.</p>
<p>However, he apologised to those who had attended the meeting, including his fellow ministers.</p>
<p>The ministers who attended yesterday were caught off guard by my reaction. I offer my sincerest apologies, he said.</p>
<p>The MyDigital ID initiative, announced by Anwar in November last year, has registered over 1.2 million users. It is intended to serve as a secure and trusted digital identification system for Malaysians.</p>
<p>It was previously announced that citizens would be required to log into the MyJPJ app using MyDigital ID as part of Malaysias push for digitalisation and streamlined access to government services.</p>
<p>The announcement sparked mixed reactions, with some asking why the identification system was compulsory as the MyDigital ID app often froze or lagged.</p>
<p>Transport minister Loke Siew Fook subsequently announced that users could continue to access the MyJPJ app without having to log in with their MyDigital ID account. He said no official decision was made for the use of MyDigital ID in this regard.</p>
<p>Last week, addressing concerns over DNBs funding for the first 5G network, digital minister Gobind Singh Deo said the government only contributed a RM500 million equity injection in 2021 and a RM450 million shareholder loan from the Minister of Finance Incorporated in May 2023.</p>
<p>DNB is also financed through private loans, including bank loans guaranteed by the government, as well as other financial sources, he added.</p>
<p>Gobind said that the telecommunication companies in DNB must pay the government before the second 5G network can be implemented.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Fashion Valet Sdn Bhd founders Vivy Yusof and her husband Fadzaruddin Shah Anuar pleaded not guilty at the sessions court here today to a joint charge of criminal breach of trust (CBT) involving RM8 million.</p>
<p>The fashion entrepreneur, whose full name is Vivy Sofinas Yusof, and Fadzaruddin, both 36, claimed trial after the charge was read to them before judge Rosli Ahmad.</p>
<p>They are accused of making a payment of RM8 million from Fashion Valet to 30 Maple Sdn Bhd, the firm that operates luxury headscarf brand Duck, without the board of directors approval.</p>
<p>They allegedly made the transfer at Public Banks branch in Bukit Damansara on Aug 21, 2018, in their capacity as directors of Fashion Valet.</p>
<div class='youtube-container'></div>
<p>The amount was allegedly taken from an entrusted investment fund of sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd and asset manager Permodalan Nasional Bhd.</p>
<p>The charge was framed under Section 409 of the Penal Code, read with Section 34 of the same code, which provides for imprisonment of between two and 20 years, whipping, and a fine, upon conviction.</p>
<p>The court allowed Vivy and Fadzaruddin bail of RM100,000 each and ordered them to report to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission office in Kuala Lumpur once a month.</p>
<p>They were also told to surrender their passports until the conclusion of the case.</p>
<p>Deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin handled the prosecution while lawyer Ashok Athimulan acted for both the accused.</p>
<p>The court fixed Jan 22 next year for case mention.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Former Pasir Salak MP Tajuddin Abdul Rahman has urged ex-Umno leaders who were expelled or suspended to follow his example by apologising if they still care about the party.</p>
<p>Tajuddin, whose suspension was lifted on Nov 25, said there was no harm in apologising and persistently appealing as he had done until his reinstatement was accepted by Umno president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.</p>
<p>You lose nothing by doing so, and no one will ridicule you by saying that you were once bold but are now seeking forgiveness, he told FMT in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>Apologising is an act of bravery, and so is forgiving. Those who continue to hold grudges are cowards and weak, he added.</p>
<p>Several Umno leaders were sacked from the party in the aftermath of the 15th general election (GE15), including former youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin. Former Umno vice-president Hishammuddin Hussein and ex-information chief Shahril Hamdan were suspended for six years.</p>
<p>Tajuddin was likewise given a six-year suspension from Umno in September 2022, after openly criticising Zahids leadership. He was also excluded as a Barisan Nasional candidate for the Pasir Salak parliamentary seat in GE15.</p>
<p>Yesterday, FMT reported Tajuddin as saying that PAS had tried to convince him to defend his seat under the partys banner in the GE15. However, he said he declined out of loyalty to Umno.</p>
<p>Tajuddin, who once served on the Umno Supreme Council, said he was reluctant to take on the role of a mediator in efforts to bring back expelled party leaders.</p>
<p>Im still considering whether Im the right person to persuade them. I dont want to be accused of overstepping my role.</p>
<p>But well see in the near future. If theres an opportunity, we can discuss it, he said, expressing confidence that many former Umno leaders who were sacked or suspended still cared for the party.</p>
<p>My advice to those who were suspended or expelled is: lets put the past behind us for the sake of the partys future.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: An Industrial Court has upheld the sacking of a Maybank clerk who accessed her former husbands bank account without his consent, saying the stern action will instil public confidence in financial institutions.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old claimant was dismissed on Aug 17, 2022, following a domestic inquiry which found her guilty of unauthorised access of the accounts of her ex-husband and 23 others following a probe.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur Industrial Court chairman Augustine Anthony said the court was mindful of the numerous public complaints about data breaches which have caused loss and misery to many innocent people.</p>
<p>Unauthorised banking transactions are a source of tremendous worry where peoples life savings have sometimes been lost due to various scams and cybercrimes. This court is also aware that mobile devices play a very significant role in the online and internet banking system.</p>
<p>Conscious of this role, financial institutions are investing heavily in risk management with a view to securing the safety and integrity of customers personal data and information. All these efforts will be futile if employees disregard strict banking policies and standard operating procedures, he said in an award delivered last month.</p>
<p>Anthony said Maybank began investigations after the claimants husband lodged a complaint in April 2022.</p>
<p>The court heard that the couple divorced in 2021 and that the claimant, who had served Maybank for 15 years, had accessed his account even after their separation.</p>
<p>Anthony said the claimant had kept screenshots of transactions involving 23 other account holders in her handphone, which her ex-husband submitted to the bank to facilitate the probe.</p>
<p>The court said it could not accept the claimants testimony that she had her ex-husbands consent to access his account.</p>
<p>It is not believable in light of the former husbands complaint to the bank.</p>
<p>In any event, at the time the claimant accessed his banking account, they were divorced. Based on the claimants own evidence, their relationship had become so acrimonious that it is not believable that the complainant would have given her his consent, the award read.</p>
<p>Anthony commended Maybanks counsel HR Dipendra for exercising restraint when cross-examining the claimant, saying the lawyer was exceedingly professional and courteous for asking only the most relevant questions in view of the sensitive nature of the dispute.</p>
<p>The court also described the claimants action in submitting four letters purportedly issued by customers granting her consent to access their accounts strange since they were all dated one day after she was issued a show-cause letter by the bank.</p>
<p>None of these letters were produced by the claimant during the show cause and investigative stage.</p>
<p>The claimants excuse that she had forgotten to do so due to the stress she was under is unacceptable, said Anthony.</p>
<p>This was a clear afterthought designed in preparation for the case, he said.</p>
<p>In any case, he said the claimant had, in breach of the banks policy and procedures, failed to obtain the requisite consent before accessing the accounts.</p>
<p>Anthony said the conduct of the claimant had exposed the bank to serious consequences.</p>
<p>He said the claimants conduct of retaining the customers information in her mobile device was a clear breach of her employment contract and a serious misconduct that warranted her dismissal.</p>
<p>Dipendra and Nur Azmina Izzati appeared for Maybank, while Naveen Joshua Solomon and P Kirthika represented the claimant.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Veteran politician Syed Hamid Albar has admitted that joining Bersatu was a mistake, saying the party has significantly deviated from its original commitment to further the cause of the Malays and Islam.</p>
<p>In his biography Idealis: Syed Hamid Albar, the former minister revealed that he joined Bersatu seeking a new platform to continue his political fight after observing Umnos deterioration.</p>
<p>He said he chose Bersatu because he believed the party could offer a platform to champion the two causes that were close to his heart dating back to the time when he was a member of Umnos Supreme Council.</p>
<p>Those were also the causes that led him to accept without hesitation an invitation from Dr Mahathir Mohamad, then Bersatus chairman, to join the party.</p>

<p>Syed Hamids membership was formally announced by Mahathirs son and then Bersatu deputy president Mukhriz Mahathir on Sept 26, 2018. He would go on to be appointed chairman of the partys election committee.</p>
<p>Mahathir became prime minister for a second time after Pakatan Harapan (PH) won the 2018 general election, ending Barisan Nasionals 60-year rule.</p>
<p>Over time, Syed Hamid realised that his decision to join the party was a mistake.</p>
<p>When Syed Hamid joined Bersatu, he expected to continue his fight for the Malays and Islam. But his expectations were not met, and he found the party increasingly straying from its original mission and its intended purpose.</p>
<div class='youtube-container'></div>
<p>The book said Syed Hamid felt disillusioned by the many issues plaguing the party and the fact that none of its leaders sought advice from him despite his status as a seasoned politician.</p>
<p>He began to feel like a puppet, unable to contribute anything meaningful. At age 78, he realised that he had spent too much of his life in the political arena, and on Feb 18, 2022, withdrew from Bersatu and announced his retirement from politics, the book read.</p>
<p><strong>Like beating a dead horse</strong></p>
<p>The biography also revealed Syed Hamids regret that his long-held desire to see out his political career in Umno, the party he had been a part of for 50 years, would remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>He left Umno, on June 26, 2018, after no longer being able to tolerate rampant corruption and abuse of power. He likened attempts on his part to address those issues to flogging a dead horse.</p>
<p>He also criticised the partys leaders and its members for their disregard of the law.</p>
<p>The former Kota Tinggi MP said Umno was very different when he first joined Umno, and fought hard under the ideals of struggle and sacrifice. However, he observed that this spirit faded after the success of the New Economic Policy.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: Perikatan Nasional is unlikely to be a major contender in the next Sabah state election and is not expected to do well unless it strikes a pact with other parties for the polls, said Universiti Malaysia Sabahs Bilcher Bala.</p>
<p>Although its immediate rivals  Pakatan Harapan, Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) and Barisan Nasional  have yet to finalise their alliances, PN looks set to come up against a formidable grand coalition in the election, he added.</p>
<p>He said PNs most likely poster boy for the state polls is expected to be former minister and Beluran MP Ronald Kiandee.</p>

<p>However, he said Kiandee, a Bersatu vice-president, would struggle to draw voters due to his lack of prominence in PN and the party.</p>
<p>Aside from Kiandee, there is no figure in Bersatu or PAS who can compete with the popularity of the leaders in GRS, especially those in Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (PGRS), most of whom were formerly from Bersatu and Umno.</p>
<p>PN should seek to form an alliance with local parties to get stronger support, rather than go solo, he told FMT.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of relevance</strong></p>
<p>However, Oh Ei Sun of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs is doubtful of PNs ability to forge any meaningful political alliance. He said there appears to be no suggestion that parties were courting Sabah PN as an ally for the polls.</p>
<p>Oh said PN has struggled to remain relevant in Sabah, especially following an exodus of Sabah Bersatu leaders led by current chief minister Hajiji Noor shortly after the 2022 general election.</p>
<p>As Bersatu is neither leading the federal nor state government, it is not in a position to dish out largesse. It falls, perhaps, on PAS to lead the weakened coalition.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen to what extent PASs religiously conspicuous political position can make inroads into Sabah, in particular in the interiors, he said.</p>
<p>At Bersatus general assembly on Sunday, PN chairman Muhyiddin Yassin said the coalitions top leadership will in the near future discuss its chief ministerial candidate and whether to go solo or enter into an alliance with other parties for the state polls.</p>
<p>The former prime minister also pledged to champion each and every demand under the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63), saying it would form the core of PNs state election manifesto.</p>
<p><strong>MA63-centric manifesto nothing special</strong></p>
<p>Bilcher, however, dismissed Muhyiddins promise as unspectacular, saying MA63 is expected to feature prominently in every partys campaign.</p>
<p>MA63 is going to be the core of every partys manifesto as it is the reason behind the slow pace of Sabahs development.</p>
<p>Oh agreed, saying MA63 was a convenient and popular election pledge for contesting parties to take on compared to the more arduous vow of implementing infrastructural improvements in Sabah.</p>
<p>He, however, said it was odd for PN, a coalition comprising mostly West Malaysia-based parties, to champion MA63 for Sabahans.</p>
<p>Bilcher also said PN should consider naming younger candidates alongside veteran politicians to attract votes from among the states youth.</p>

<p>GEORGE TOWN: Former Penang deputy chief minister P Ramasamy is being investigated after a complaint about alleged corrupt practices in the procurement by the Penang Hindu Endowments Board (PHEB) of a Golden Chariot for Thaipusam some five years ago, says a source.</p>
<p>Ramasamy, who was the PHEB chairman from 2010 to 2023, was yesterday barred from leaving the country by immigration officers at the Penang International Airport after being informed that he had been blacklisted due to a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) directive.</p>
<p>A MACC source told FMT the anti-graft agency had received a complaint several months ago alleging that the chariot was not pure gold as claimed. The source also said MACC had received a complaint about purported irregularities involving PHEB, which owns the chariot.</p>
<p>The source, who is close to the investigation, said it was very normal for a travel ban to be placed on individuals being probed. The MACC source said the boards former executive director and CEO M Ramachandran was also under investigation.</p>
<p>We received a complaint that PHEB, during Ramasamy and Ramachandrans time, overpaid for the chariot when they were supplied with very low quality material (which was) not up to specifications, said the source.</p>
<p>Since this is a matter of public interest, MACC has decided to start investigating the two.</p>
<p>The source added that the chemistry department had been roped in to check if the chariot had the same amount of gold as claimed.</p>
<p>In August, Bernama reported that current PHEB chairman RSN Rayer had submitted PHEBs findings of an internal forensic audit to MACC. Rayer claimed that the audit had uncovered several red flags, but did not elaborate on them.</p>
<p><strong>It is a gold-plated chariot, says Ramasamy</strong></p>
<p>Ramasamy yesterday told FMT that he categorically denied such claims, saying the auditor-general had vetted PHEBs accounts during his tenure.</p>
<p>He said the chariot, which was bought in 2019 and the second of its kind, was gold-plated rather than solid gold.</p>
<p>To say it was made of substandard material is misleading. It was gold-plated, which naturally involves the use of other metals, he said.</p>
<p>The cost of the chariot was approximately RM800,000, according to Ramasamy, who said the project was awarded through an open tender involving three contractors  two from India and one local.</p>
<p>Ramasamy said after an evaluation by PHEBs board, the contract was ultimately given to a company from India which requested payment in cash.</p>
<p>He said about RM400,000 in cash was paid to the contractor, with the remainder going towards other project expenses such as the shipping cost of materials from India.</p>
<p>He said all payments were approved by the PHEB board and reported to the relevant authorities, especially the auditor-general, since the board was under federal purview.</p>
<p>We followed all procedures. PHEB is audited yearly by the auditor-generals office, and our reports are presented to Parliament, not the state assembly, he said.</p>
<p><strong>MACC relying on incomplete documents</strong></p>
<p>Ramasamy said MACC was relying on incomplete documents and had failed to understand the complexities of PHEBs overlapping state and federal jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Urimai president also claimed that his political opponents were orchestrating the probe to tarnish his reputation.</p>
<p>These allegations are baseless. If theres evidence of a money trail leading to my bank account, they should prove it. Let them investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>I believe this is political persecution. Ive been vocal in the opposition, and the travel ban is part of a coordinated effort to discredit me, he said.</p>
<p>Ramasamy, who voluntarily headed to the MACC office at Northam Road yesterday and had his statement taken, said he had seen Ramachandran in MACC lock-up garb.</p>
<p>I am not sure where they are taking him, he added.</p>
<p>FMT has contacted MACC on Ramachandrans whereabouts and tried reaching out to him for comment.</p>
<p>When contacted, MACC chief commissioner Azam Baki confirmed that both Ramasamy and Ramachandran were under investigation.</p>
<p>He provided no further details.</p>

<p>SUBANG JAYA: In 2015, Billy Tangs world came crashing down when he was involved in an accident that left him paralysed from the waist down.</p>
<p>Thanks to support from his family and friends, Tan clung to a glimmer of hope and rebuilt his life from a wheelchair, believing where theres a will <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2023/10/29/for-billy-tang-where-theres-a-wheel-theres-a-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;">and wheels</span></a>, theres a way.</p>
<p>His tenacity has paid off: on Tuesday, the 58-year-old received the prestigious Oxford Award for Lifetime Achievement in Humanitarian Impact and Global Sustainability, as well as an honorary doctorate, for his contributions to sustainable agriculture, social innovation, and the empowerment of persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The ceremony, held in the UK at Oxford Town Hall, was certainly timely: Dec 3 is commemorated as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p>In the years following his accident, Tang designed a box that uses soil microbiology to harvest vegetables at home. The Organic Regenerative Vegetable Terrarium Hope Box enables even the poorest to feed themselves.</p>
<p>He also started a social enterprise called PWD Smart FarmAbility, and introduced the Regenerative Organic Soil-U-tion Aquaponics Satellite Farm System, an organic way to farm freshwater fishes.</p>

<p>Through PWD Smart Farmability, Tang champions regenerative agriculture, food security solutions, and the philosophy of food as medicine, built on the knowledge that food and diet have important roles in supporting health and wellness.</p>
<p>On top of all this, Tang graduated with a PhD in agriculture and food security from Wilmington Metropolitan University on Nov 22. These are impressive achievements for someone who once contemplated exiting the earth.</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed that someone from a marginalised community is experiencing inclusion, Tang told FMT Lifestyle.</p>
<p>Inclusion is not about giving charity; it is about giving opportunity. It is about recognising the inherent worth and potential of every individual, regardless of their backgrounds and abilities.</p>
<p>It is about building systems that empower rather than exclude, that uplift rather than oppress.</p>

<p>During the Oxford ceremony, Tang officially launched his coffee table book, The PWD Smart FarmAbility  Journey from Wheels to Farm, which details his innovations and the impact these have made.</p>
<p>He also unveiled a song, Rise Again, dedicated to Tang and written by Vincent Yong, Oxford Awards Asia region strategic representative.</p>
<p><strong>Rising up, breaking through</strong></p>
<p>Maximus Pheng, who had proposed that Tang be nominated for the Oxford award, told FMT Lifestyle: I saw him rising up after his accident, breaking through and inspiring others. Through his life, I hope the younger generation will learn about perseverance.</p>
<p>Pheng, 54, also received the Oxford Award for Excellence in Ethical Leadership and an honorary doctorate in financial education.</p>
<p>As for whats next, Tang shared: My vision is to see every street and community with persons with disabilities have access to nutritious food.</p>

<p>To that end, he has introduced his inventions in over 30 schools in Selangor with the Integrated Special Education Programme (PPKI), aiming to equip students with the skills, knowledge and confidence to be entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>His goal is for them to be self-sustaining in the future instead of relying on the publics goodwill to survive.</p>
<p>Next, he plans to introduce a Nature-Inspired Oxygen Wellness Hub in these schools, an innovative facility designed to promote respiratory health and holistic wellbeing.</p>
<p>And in the future, he hopes a technology hub displaying innovations by persons with disabilities can be built. This is where we can show others what we are capable of.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tangs success in turning bitter into better is a powerful inspiration, one that testifies to how one great things can be accomplished through faith, determination and perseverance.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: A businessman has been left baffled by a banks closure of his companys account three years ago, shortly after it received a substantial investment running into millions of Euros.</p>
<p>He told FMT the banks branch in Sabah has refused to furnish any reason to justify the closure.</p>
<p>Police also told FMT that they did not know why the account was closed. They said neither the company nor its managing director was under investigation. There was also no police order to freeze or close the account, Bukit Amans anti-money laundering unit said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara Malaysia, which regulates banking activities, told FMT the decision to close the account lies with the financial institution involved, which is also subject to their internal risk management appetite.</p>
<p>When contacted, the bank declined comment for this story.</p>
<p>According to the companys managing director, the funds were intended to finance the construction of oil and gas storage tanks in Sipitang, Sabah, as part of the Sipitang Oil &amp; Gas Industrial Park.</p>
<p>He said the closure of his companys account in 2021 had delayed the execution of the project, resulting in significant losses to the company.</p>
<p>He said the bank had refused to comply with two demands issued by the companys lawyers seeking the reactivation of the account. However, the company was not in a position to file a civil suit against the bank due to financial difficulties, he added.</p>
<p>The closure of our account without reasonable and valid justification has, to some extent, given a negative perception of Malaysia in terms of foreign investment, he said.</p>
<p>In a letter to the managing director, the bank said it reserves the right to close any of its banking accounts by giving 14 days notice.</p>
<p>The bank also said its terms and conditions entitle it to exercise its reasonable discretion regarding whether to provide account holders with notice of closure of their account.</p>
<p>The bank also said it was not under any obligation to disclose the reason for the closure of an account unless required by law.</p>
<p>When contacted, Bukit Amans anti-money laundering division said the managing director was not under investigation.</p>
<p>We can confirm that the company and its directors have not been under investigation. We also dont know why his bank account was closed, said the division.</p>
<p>From our perspective, an investigation paper needs to be opened if we want a bank account to be closed or frozen  and that did not happen.</p>
<p>The companys managing director said both the police and BNM have referred him back to the bank for a resolution of the matter.</p>
<p>In an email to FMT, BNM confirmed this, saying it had conducted a comprehensive review of the businessmans complaint.</p>
<p>He also gave FMT sight of a letter issued by the Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) confirming that the companys account was neither subject to seizure by any of the enforcement agencies nor frozen on the AGCs instructions.</p>
<p>It recommended that the businessman discuss the matter with the bank.</p>

<p>PARIS:French lawmakers on Wednesday voted to oust the government of prime minister Michel Barnier after just three months in office, a historic move which hurled the country further into political uncertainty.</p>
<p>For the first time in more than 60 years, the national assembly lower house toppled the incumbent government, approving a no-confidence motion that had been proposed by the hard left but which crucially was backed by the far-right headed by Marine Le Pen.</p>
<p>Barniers rapid ejection from office comes after snap parliamentary elections this summer which resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority and the far-right holding the key to the governments survival.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron now has the unenviable choice of picking a viable successor with over two years of his presidential term left.</p>
<p>He is to address the nation at 1900 GMT on Thursday, the Elysee said.</p>
<p>The national assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next years austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.</p>
<p>With the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.</p>
<p>Speaker Yael Braun-Pivet confirmed Barnier would now have to submit his resignation to Macron and declared the session closed.</p>
<p><strong>Calling on Macron to go</strong></p>
<p>Macron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.</p>
<p>He strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.</p>
<p>We are now calling on Macron to go, Mathilde Panot, the head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party told reporters, urging early presidential elections to solve the deepening political crisis.</p>
<p>But taking care not to crow over the fall of the government, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party  once a new prime minister is appointed  would let them work and help create a budget that is acceptable for everyone.</p>
<p>Laurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that will plunge the country into instability.</p>
<p><strong>His failure</strong></p>
<p>Macron on Tuesday had rejected calls to resign, saying such a scenario amounted to political fiction.</p>
<p>With markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.</p>
<p>The unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president.</p>
<p>His failure was left-wing daily Liberations front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027.</p>
<p><strong>Shattered strategy</strong></p>
<p>In an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pens move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government.</p>
<p>In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued, the daily said.</p>
<p>Some observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.</p>
<p>Le Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in Frances next presidential election.</p>
<p>But if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial.</p>
<p>Candidates for the post of prime minister are few, but loyalist defence minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macrons centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders.</p>
<p>On the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist prime minister and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September.</p>
<p>Macron is minded to appoint the new prime minister rapidly, several sources told AFP.</p>
<p>It was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidous government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.</p>
<p>The lifespan of Barniers government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: The kebaya, a traditional garment beloved across Southeast Asia, has been officially added to Unescos Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>
<p>The announcement was made on Wednesday during a Unesco meeting in Asuncin, Paraguay, according to Unescos X page.</p>
<p>Malaysia, led by the tourism, arts and culture ministry, worked with Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand to nominate the kebaya and has agreed to safeguard the kebayas future by organising workshops, classes, and research projects.</p>
<p>The ministry describes the kebaya as a garment that represents our rich shared history and brings people together by promoting understanding between cultures.</p>
<p>Locally, the kebaya is worn by Malay, Peranakan (Baba Nyonya, Chetti, Siamese, Kristang), and other communities.</p>
<p>It is known for its delicate embroidery and sewing techniques which have been passed down through generations. These traditional skills meet Unescos criteria for intangible cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The kebaya also plays a key role in cultural events like weddings and festivals, and is also worn by Malaysia Airlines flight attendants.</p>
<p>According to a ministry handout online, the nomination process began in 2022 with officials, cultural experts, and kebaya community members from all five countries working together.</p>
<p>Malaysia hosted the first workshop in Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan, in November 2022. This was followed by another workshop in Jakarta in February 2023, hosted by Indonesia.</p>
<p>Singapore then led the final online meeting in March 2023 to complete the nomination.</p>

<p>TAWAU: A Lahad Datu Vocational College student testified in the High Court today that the second accused in the case of Nazmie Aizzat Narul Azwans murder had instructed everyone in Room 5 of their hostel to leave him alone with the victim on the night of the incident on March 21.</p>
<p>The 17th prosecution witness said upon receiving the instruction, several occupants of the room, including 10 of the accused who had been involved in assaulting the victim, exited the room.</p>
<p>The second accused told everyone to leave, saying leave him with me. But I didnt leave because I was tired. A few other occupants also stayed.</p>
<p>I closed the door because I was scared and lay on the bed.</p>
<p>At that time, the second accused and the victim were standing near a bed. I saw the accused punch the victim in the shoulder and kick him in the head and waist. Then I saw the accused drag the victim by his hand to the middle of the room. The victim struggled to get free.</p>
<p>The accused then pushed the victim into the lockers, causing a loud bang, he said during the examination-in-chief by deputy public prosecutor Nur Nisla Abd Latif at the trial before Justice Duncan Sikodol.</p>
<p>Thirteen students, aged between 16 and 19, are charged with jointly murdering Nazmie, 17, in Room 7 and Room 5 (Belian) at the college between 9pm on March 21 and 7.39am on March 22.</p>
<p>The charge, framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code and read together with Section 34 of the same code, carries the death penalty or imprisonment for 30 to 40 years and not more than 12 strokes of the cane, upon conviction.</p>
<p>The witness testified that after hearing a loud bang, the first, fifth and sixth accused entered the room and told the second accused to stop. However, the second accused told them to leave and the door was closed again.</p>
<p>He added that once the door was closed, the second accused continued to assault the victim, prompting Nazmie to plead for it to stop and call out to the first accused for help.</p>
<p>The second accused then took the victim out of the room, but I dont know where he was taken, he said.</p>
<p>The 18th prosecution witness, also a student at the college, then testified that he saw the victim asleep on a mattress on the floor, covered in blankets, when he entered Room 7 at 5am to take his toiletries.</p>
<p>After taking a shower, I saw the 11th accused trying to wake the victim, but he didnt respond.</p>

<p>PETALING JAYA: The former CEO of a company embroiled in a corruption investigation involving Sabah assemblymen has announced plans to file a RM30 million lawsuit against the firm, its current CEO, and the company secretary.</p>
<p>Jontih Enggihon said the malicious conspiracy had irreparably tarnished his reputation and caused him severe mental distress.</p>
<p>He said the lawsuit was in response to Sabah Mineral Management (SMM) Sdn Bhds <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2024/11/18/sabah-minerals-firm-accuses-ex-ceo-of-breach-of-duty-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;">accusations</span> </a>against him.</p>
<p>He is also suing SMM CEO Natasha Sim and the company secretary over their allegations of misconduct.</p>
<p>I am working with my legal counsel to initiate civil action against (them) for reputational damage, mental damage, and the anguish they have caused, he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last month, SMM accused Jontih of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and misconduct.</p>
<p>Reports were lodged with the police and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) accusing him of colluding with a purported whistleblower.</p>
<p>The whistleblower is said to be behind the video clips alleging several Sabah assemblymen of being involved in corrupt practices.</p>
<p>Sim had said Jontihs alleged wrongdoing was uncovered following a comprehensive internal probe into his affairs while holding the post.</p>
<p>Jontih had previously denied the allegations and said the claim that he had acted as a middleman between the whistleblower and assemblymen was a total lie.</p>
<p>Jontih today stressed that he had fully cooperated with MACC and the polices investigation into the allegations, adding that he was confident he would be proven innocent and justice would be served.</p>
<p>He also claimed he had proof that Sim and the company secretary did not disclose they were on a private jet to Indonesia earlier this year as part of the entourage on a sponsored trip by an Indonesian company  a claim which Sim has since <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2024/11/29/sabah-mineral-boss-denies-not-disclosing-sponsored-trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff0000;">denied</span></a>.</p>
<p>A timber trader and his two children were also on the trip, alleged Jontih.</p>
<p>Jontih today said the trip, estimated to cost RM400,000, coincided with the approval of prospecting licences for both the Indonesian company and the timber trader by SMM.</p>
<p>After verifying with one of the directors from the Indonesian company yesterday, (their) attendance on that flight was confirmed, he said.</p>
<p>Jontih alleged that Sim and the company secretary conspired to frame him as part of a calculated move to protect their own interests.</p>
<p>He also claimed to have voice recordings and other evidence showing the company secretary prepared misleading documents, while Sim used outdated records to deceive SMMs board.</p>
<p>I urge the authorities to conduct an in-depth investigation into this incident. This is a severe crime.</p>
