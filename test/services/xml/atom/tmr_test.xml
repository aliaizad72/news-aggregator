<p>&#8220;Endometrial cancer is often detected early as its curable stages. For individuals with more advanced cancer, the treatment options have been more limited. With more treatment options we can select the one that is most beneficial to the individual, said <b>Dr. <span class="xn-person">Katharina Kieser</span>, Provincial Lead Gynaecologic Oncology at <span class="xn-org">Dalhousie University</span></b>. &#8220;Having public access to new clinical therapies is vital to help improve the cancer care journey for patients. This announcement represents a critical and positive step forward for endometrial cancer patients across <span class="xn-location">Nova Scotia</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Jemperli</i> in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was approved by Health Canada in <span class="xn-chron">November 2023</span> as a treatment option for adult patients with primary advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer in patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. <i>Jemperli</i> is the only immuno-oncology treatment option approved for this patient population in combination with chemotherapy in Canada. </p>
<p>&#8220;Amidst the rising cancer rates across <span class="xn-location">Nova Scotia</span>, this announcement speaks to the commitment by <span class="xn-location">Nova Scotia&#8217;s</span> government to prioritizing public access to innovative treatments like <i>Jemperli</i> for cancer care,&#8221; said <b><span class="xn-person">Filomena Servidio-Italiano</span>, President and CEO of the Colorectal Cancer Resource &amp; Action Network (CCRAN)</b>. &#8220;At CCRAN, we relentlessly advocate and focus on ensuring equal and timely access to effective therapies aiming to improve patient outcomes – and we hope other provinces will follow <span class="xn-location">Nova Scotia&#8217;s</span> lead in prioritizing cancer needs across <span class="xn-location">Canada</span>. CCRAN remains dedicated to improving the longevity and quality of life for all cancer patients in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We commend the <span class="xn-location">Nova Scotia</span> government for their pioneering role in becoming the first province or territory in <span class="xn-location">Canada</span> to publicly reimburse <i>Jemperli</i> for endometrial cancer patients in need,&#8221; said <b><span class="xn-person">Sridhar Venkatesh</span>, President &amp; General Manager, GSK Canada</b>. &#8220;We look forward to working with additional provincial and territorial governments in an effort to make <i>Jemperli</i> available to all Canadians who need it.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>About endometrial cancer<br /></b>Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecologic cancers in developed countries,<sup></sup><sup>[i]</sup><sup>v </sup>and there are about 8,100 new cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed every year in <span class="xn-location">Canada</span><sup> v</sup>. Approximately 15-20% of patients with endometrial cancer will be diagnosed with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.<sup>vi vii  </sup>An estimated 20-29% of all endometrial cancers are dMMR/MSI-H.<sup></sup><sup>[ii]</sup> Chemotherapy has been the current standard of care for the majority of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, and many patients eventually experience disease progression.<sup>viii</sup></p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://themalaysianreserve.com/2024/12/05/mantle-ridge-issues-statement/"><![CDATA[<p><span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-location">NEW YORK</span></span>, <span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-chron">Dec. 5, 2024</span></span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Mantle Ridge LP (&#8220;Mantle Ridge&#8221;), which together with its affiliates beneficially owns more than <span class="xn-money">$1 billion</span> of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (NYSE: APD) (&#8220;Air Products&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) shares, today issued the following statement:</p>
<p>It was reported in the press today that:</p>
<p>&#8220;Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. experienced a 2.3% drop in its stock price in pre-open trading on Thursday. This decline came as a result of activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge LP withdrawing its earlier push for a board overhaul at the industrial gas company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shareholders should not fear.  As has been our consistent practice in every project we have done, and has been evident from our filings and communications with the Board, we seek a restructuring of the Board to one that can enable new executives to succeed, and better board performance.  This necessarily includes a meaningful minority of ongoing incumbent directors, and new independents that would comprise a majority of the reconstituted Board. </p>
<p>In this case, we are nominating four, and the Company is nominating two, entirely new and independent candidates (six directors out of nine would be new and independent). We encourage shareholders to closely read our proxy filings.</p>
<p>The board slate as specified in our amended filing should in our view be sufficient to allow the Company to approach the future on a strong footing.  It seeks replacement of the four most problematic directors, the addition of four new ones we have nominated, and a process to replace the current CEO.</p>
<p>Because the Board would not engage in a collaborative process of Board reconstruction, we took the initiative to compose this board solution on our own, informed by our fellow shareholders&#8217; preferences and desires for change.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the support from our fellow shareholders and are excited about the wonderful chapter ahead for the Company.&#8221;</p>

The lifting of the Suspension allows the Company to continue development of the Project, re-establish community programs, and advance activities necessary to achieve a positive final investment decision (&#8220;<b>FID</b>&#8220;).</p>
<p>The MOU announced today is the culmination of extensive negotiations over several years with the Malagasy Government on fiscal and other terms applicable to the Toliara Project and a major step forward in advancing the Project. While the Company is progressing towards an FID, which is expected to be made in approximately 14 months, the Company will continue working with the Government of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span> to formalize the terms and conditions set out in the MOU through the implementation of a &#8220;<b>Stability Mechanism</b>&#8221; consisting of one or a combination of the following: (a) submittal of an Investment Agreement to the Madagascar Parliament for approval as law and certification of the Toliara Project (&#8220;<b>Project Certification</b>&#8220;) under existing law establishing a special regime for large scale investments in the Malagasy mining sector (the &#8220;<b>LGIM</b> &#8220;); (b) promulgation of amendments and revisions to the existing LGIM (the &#8220;<b>LGIM Amendment</b>&#8220;) in a form that provides for the necessary certainty of financial and legal terms, and reasonable financial, operational and legal requirements, for large-scale projects and have Project Certification under the amended LGIM, together with an Investment Agreement (if reasonably required) submitted to Parliament for approval as law; and/or (c) another agreed upon mechanism that achieves the necessary certainty of financial and legal terms, and reasonable financial, operational and legal requirements, applying to large-scale mining projects.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Mark S. Chalmers</span>, President and CEO of Energy Fuels commented: &#8220;As I&#8217;ve said before, I believe the Toliara Project is a &#8216;generational&#8217; critical mineral project that has the strong potential to operate well beyond many of our lifetimes. Therefore, it is vital to Energy Fuels, and to our Base Resources subsidiaries, that the Republic of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span> and the communities in the vicinity of the Project enjoy significant benefits that go beyond jobs, economic development, and sustainable operations that respect human rights, local culture, and the environment. To achieve this vision, the MOU signed today creates the framework for a long-term mutually beneficial partnership between a U.S. critical mineral company and the people of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span>. We look forward to continuing to work with the Government of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span> to formalize the terms of the MOU and grow our relationship with what we believe will be the largest U.S. investment in the country&#8217;s history.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Key Terms and Conditions of the MOU</b></p>
<p>Under the MOU, the Company has agreed to pay a five percent (5%) royalty (and no other) on mining products and deliver <span class="xn-money">US$80 million</span> after Project Certification in development, community, and social project funding, including a total of <span class="xn-money">$30 million</span> within 30 days after Project Certification, another <span class="xn-money">$10 million</span> within 30 days after achieving a positive FID and an additional <span class="xn-money">$40 million</span> by the fourth year of operations. In addition, the Company has agreed to spend at least <span class="xn-money">$1 million</span> prior to FID in the Atsimo Andrefana Region on community and social investments, and <span class="xn-money">$4 million</span> annually thereafter, indexed at 2% per annum, from commencement of construction after a positive FID. The Company has also committed to developing the Toliara Project in an environmentally, socially and fiscally responsible manner, and to observe the specific protections set out in the MOU.</p>
<p>The payments described above are not expected to have a material effect on the economics of this potentially multi-billion project, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4318547-1&amp;h=2319661774&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.energyfuels.com%2F2024-04-21-Energy-Fuels-Announces-Agreement-for-Transformational-Acquisition-of-Base-Resources%2C-Creating-a-Global-Leader-in-Critical-Minerals-Production-with-a-Focus-on-Uranium%2C-Rare-Earth-Elements-and-Heavy-Mineral-Sands&amp;a=which+(along+with+the+appropriate+disclaimers+related+to+technical+disclosure)+are+described+in+the+Company%27s+April+2024+press+release" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which (along with the appropriate disclaimers related to technical disclosure) are described in the Company&#8217;s <span class="xn-chron">April 2024</span> press release</a>. The Company is in the process of updating the <span class="xn-chron">September 2021</span> definitive feasibility study and <span class="xn-chron">December 2023</span> prefeasibility study on the Toliara Project, along with the White Mesa Mill&#8217;s 2024 prefeasibility study on rare earth oxide production, to reflect current economics.</p>
<p>The Government has agreed in the MOU, among other things, to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>assist the Company with obtaining all necessary administrative authorizations for the purpose of adding REE-bearing monazite recovery to existing permits;</li>
<li>certify the Project as eligible under the LGIM (or amended LGIM, if applicable) as soon as the LGIM eligibility conditions are met; support the prompt development of the Toliara Project, including (without limitation) by causing all relevant State authorities to timely consider and grant all complete applications for permits, licenses or authorizations necessary or desirable for the development and operation of the Toliara Project in accordance with the laws of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span>;</li>
<li>maintain the fiscal, legal and customs stability of the Toliara Project;</li>
<li>not, directly or indirectly, receive, take or have an interest (including an economic interest or form of production sharing arrangement, and whether carried or free-carried) in the Company or any of its assets, including the Toliara Project;</li>
<li>provide active and public support for the Toliara Project, including by publicly announcing the State&#8217;s support for the Toliara Project and its development; and</li>
<li>undertake any LGIM amendments in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Company, to ensure that such amendments (or similar instruments with legislative force) provide the necessary certainty of financial and legal terms to address the reasonable financial, operational and legal requirements of large-scale mining projects, and otherwise supports the bankability of the Toliara Project and the ability of the Company to achieve a positive FID.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, under the MOU, the Company&#8217;s agreement to pay a 5% royalty on revenues and its commitments to pay the <span class="xn-money">US$80 million</span> in development, community and social funding are conditional on:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the terms of the Stability Mechanism being adopted in a form that is satisfactory to the Company;</li>
<li>Project Certification having been obtained; and</li>
<li>prior to Project Certification having been obtained, there being no change to the laws of <span class="xn-location">Madagascar</span> (as they apply to the Company and the Toliara Project as at the date of the MOU) that is adverse to the Company or the Toliara Project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MOU and its terms are expressly subject to the foregoing conditions set out in the MOU. It should be noted that there can be no assurance that the foregoing conditions will be satisfied or as to the timing of satisfaction of those conditions, or the timing for approval of the addition of monazite to the mining permit. If such conditions are not satisfied, this could delay any FID in relation to the Toliara Project or prevent or otherwise have a significant effect on the development of the Toliara Project or ability to recover Monazite from the Toliara Project.</p>

<p>&#8220;The landscape of trade secret litigation has transformed dramatically in recent years, driven by record-breaking jury awards and increased vulnerabilities from remote work,&#8221; said <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4317956-1&amp;h=2634379924&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doar.com%2Fpeople%2Fchad-lackey%2F&amp;a=Dr.+Chad+Lackey%2C" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. <span class="xn-person">Chad Lackey</span>,</a> Director at DOAR and author of the study. &#8220;Our research challenges traditional assumptions about who supports strong trade secret protections, with surprising variations across occupations and demographics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Key findings from the study include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Young and Old Split on IP Rights:</b> While 76% of those 65 or older found it completely unacceptable for employees to take technical plans from former employers, the majority of 18-24-year-olds found this conduct acceptable.<br /> </li>
<li><b>Women Take Harder Line on IP Protection:</b> Women consistently showed stricter ethical boundaries, with 63% finding it completely unacceptable to retain an employer&#8217;s technical plans, compared to less than half of men.<br /> </li>
<li><b>Occupation Influences IP Attitudes:</b> Workers in banking and finance were consistently more accepting of sharing confidential information. In contrast, office and clerical workers were significantly more likely to find such conduct unacceptable.<br /> </li>
<li><b>Tech Workers More Lenient Than Expected:</b> Engineers were more likely than others to find it acceptable to share technical documents with new employers, with 38% approving of such conduct. Computer science and IT workers also showed greater acceptance of sharing technical information from previous employers, challenging assumptions about technical workers&#8217; attitudes toward IP protection.<br /> </li>
<li><b>Venue Less Important Than Demographics:</b> Individual characteristics and occupational background had a greater impact on attitudes than venue location, with age, gender, and occupation proving more significant predictors than jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The data reveals complex attitudes about ownership of work product,&#8221; said Dr. Lackey. &#8220;With 59% of respondents believing it&#8217;s acceptable for employees to retain technical plans they helped develop, regardless of contractual obligations, combined with significant demographic and occupational differences in attitudes, companies face new challenges in protecting their intellectual property.&#8221;</p>

Only 1,917 bottles exist, </i><i>and every purchase earns you the chance to win a deluxe trip to <span class="xn-location">Napa Valley</span>.</i></p>
<p><span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-location">OMAHA, Neb.</span></span>, <span class="legendSpanClass"><span class="xn-chron">Dec. 5, 2024</span></span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Omaha Steaks, America&#8217;s Original Butcher, and Laithwaites, the world&#8217;s No. 1 home delivery wine service, are pleased to announce the release of their most luxurious wine yet. Selected by a panel of experts to be the best red wine to pair with steak, it is the ultimate bottle to serve with special holiday meals this season and for any occasion worth celebrating—and it&#8217;s limited to 1,917 bottles in honor of the year Omaha Steaks was founded.</p>
<p><b>EXPERT PANEL HOLDS &#8220;BLIND&#8221; TASTING TO SELECT THE BEST WINE TO PAIR WITH STEAK</b></p>
<p>The Omaha Steaks 1917 Private Reserve® Cabernet Sauvignon was selected through a rigorous tasting. On a freezing (-30°F) afternoon in <span class="xn-chron">January 2024</span>, <span class="xn-person">Todd Simon</span> (Omaha Steaks fifth-generation family owner and Chief Steak Evangelist), <span class="xn-person">Nate Rempe</span> (Omaha Steaks CEO and President), <span class="xn-person">Tony Laithwaite</span> (founder of Laithwaites Wine) and members of their teams gathered in <span class="xn-location">Omaha, Nebraska</span> to taste a range of rare wines from around the world.</p>
<p>The objective: To find <i>the</i> best wine to pair with steak. The wines were exclusively selected by wine experts around the world. To remove any element of bias, each wine was tasted &#8220;blind&#8221; – meaning that no facts about the wine (including the label, bottle shape, grape variety, or geographic region) were revealed. Each member had to rate the wines independently. Hardly anyone spoke, in an effort not to influence other panel members.</p>
<p>The winning wine was determined not by how good it tasted on its own, but rather by how well it enhanced the flavor of the steak. Fittingly, Omaha Steaks Private Reserve® steaks were served alongside the wines after being expertly prepared by Omaha Steaks&#8217; corporate chef. As the results were tallied, there was a clear tension in the room as panelists realized the heavy burden put upon them (to select the best wine in the world to pair with steak). Had this ever been done before?</p>
<p>The scores were on the doors. Wines that didn&#8217;t make the cut included exceedingly rare releases from <span class="xn-location">Italy</span>, <span class="xn-location">France</span>, and <span class="xn-location">Australia</span>. In the end, there was one clear winner: a spectacular Cabernet Sauvignon from <span class="xn-location">Napa Valley&#8217;s</span> legendary <span class="xn-location">Oakville</span> district.</p>
<p><b>A COLLECTOR&#8217;S ITEM FOR STEAK &amp; WINE LOVERS</b></p>
<p>Renowned winemaker <span class="xn-person">Bill Knuttel</span> meticulously crafted this Cabernet Sauvignon from hand-harvested fruit grown in two elite, sustainably farmed vineyards in <span class="xn-location">Oakville</span>, the famous AVA (American Viticultural Area) in <span class="xn-location">Napa Valley</span>. He then aged the wine for 25 months in fine French oak barrels. In the glass, you can look forward to sumptuous flavors of blackberry, ripe blueberry, black cherry, and hints of cocoa, with a wave of velvety tannins. While delicious now, it will also age beautifully and is perfect for your favorite cut of Private Reserve® steak.</p>
<p>As you would expect, a wine this good is made in very small batches. In fact, only 1,917 bottles exist, and each is individually numbered. The wine will retail for <span class="xn-money">$149.99</span> per bottle on <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4316823-1&amp;h=13173967&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fomahasteakswine.com%2F&amp;a=OmahaSteaksWine.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OmahaSteaksWine.com</a> and is sure to sell out quickly…especially as each purchase will gain the customer entry into something very special. You can also try the Ultimate Private Reserve® Steak &amp; Wine Experience at home—a package available for <span class="xn-money">$499.99</span> that can be found by visiting <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4316823-1&amp;h=2647719907&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omahasteaks.com%2Fbuy%2FWine%2FWine-and-Steak-Packs&amp;a=OmahaSteaks.com%2Fwine" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OmahaSteaks.com/wine</a>.</p>
<p><b>THE ULTIMATE STEAK WINE + A LUXURIOUS SWEEPSTAKES</b></p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the 1917 Private Reserve® Cabernet Sauvignon, Omaha Steaks Wine is offering the chance to win a once-in-a-lifetime trip to <span class="xn-location">Napa Valley</span> for one lucky person and their guest. The package includes roundtrip airfare, three nights hotel accommodation, and a luxurious wine experience, plus ground transportation to and from the event.</p>

<p>Commenting on the news, <span class="xn-person">Todd Simon</span> said, &#8220;When we launched the Private Reserve® line of meats nearly 30 years ago, we were inspired by the winemaker practice of releasing &#8220;Reserve&#8221; wines from the very best vineyards, grapes and vintages. These cuts are the best of the best. Luxurious and indulgent. I am so thrilled to have found a wine that can perfectly complement the intensity and complexity of these cuts and provide customers with a truly unique culinary experience. I am also pleased that the winning wine happens to come from <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>, and from such a distinguished winemaker like <span class="xn-person">Bill Knuttel</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Tony Laithwaite</span> remarked, &#8220;So often, people judge a wine by how impressive it tastes on its own. That&#8217;s all well and good, but to me, wine and food are meant to be enjoyed together. What makes this Private Reserve® Cabernet so good is that it actually makes your steak taste better—and the meat enhances the flavors in the wine, too. It&#8217;s a match made in food and wine heaven, and I couldn&#8217;t be more excited for customers to try it with their favorite cuts.&#8221;</p>
